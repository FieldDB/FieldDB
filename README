This app aims to replace Word/LaTeX files for fieldlinguistics, not other existing databases. The app runs offline on Android Tablets, offline on the Chrome Store, and online on the web. The widgets can embedded individually in to any website (example data lists, data entry widgets, data search widgets, team activity feeds etc), allowing anyone to open their data if they so choose. The app is OpenSource under the Apache 2.0 license which means you can run it on your department's server, or your server, and even edit the code to make it better.
