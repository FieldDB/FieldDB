# Activity feed 

An app which is used as an embedable iframe widget built using RequireJS and AngularJS that we embedd in the Prototype but it can also be embedded on any website (such as a teams website if they want to show that they are active to the communtiy members without needing to teach the community members how to download and/or register for the app).
