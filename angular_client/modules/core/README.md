# FieldDB Angular

A library of Angular components which can be reused to create new widgets or dashboards that connect/display/interact with FieldDB data

## Getting Started

### In the browser

####Easy install:
Install the module with: `bower install fielddb-angular --save`. If you use gulp or grunt, this is all you have to do.

####Manual install:
Or, if you don't use gulp or grunt, you can download the [production version][js], and [optional vendor libraries][vendor].

[js]: https://raw.github.com/FieldDB/bower-fielddb-angular/master/dist/scripts/fielddb-angular.js
[vendor]: https://raw.github.com/FieldDB/bower-fielddb-angular/master/dist/scripts/vendor.js

In your app load the `script.js` and optionally:
* `vendor.js` packages together all the dependancies for `fielddb-angular`, or you can use the copies in your own app if they are already there (see `bower.json` for a list of `fielddb-angular`'s dependancies) 
* If you want, you can declare your own templates in your own project as long as they have the same name (eg, a custom `components/user/user.html` will replace the default user template):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/bower_components/fielddb-angular/dist/styles/vendor.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/bower_components/fielddb-angular/dist/styles/fielddb-angular.css" />

<script src="bower_components/fielddb-angular/dist/scripts/vendor.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/fielddb-angular/dist/scripts/fielddb-angular.js"></script>
```

####Load module
To use the module
* you should set the `BASE_DB_URL` and `BASE_AUTH_URL` for your FieldDB server, e.g. below
* you should include `fielddbAngular` as a dependency in your `angular.module` declaration, e.g. below
```javascript
  FieldDB.Database.prototype.BASE_DB_URL = 'https://corpusdev.lingsync.org';
  FieldDB.Database.prototype.BASE_AUTH_URL = 'https://authdev.lingsync.org';

  angular
  .module('myAppWhichUsesFieldDB', [
    'ngAnimate',
    "ngCookies",
    "ngTouch",
    "ngSanitize",
    "ui.router",
    "ui.bootstrap",
    'fielddbAngular'
  ])
  
```

## Examples

```

To show a login/logout button:

```html
<div data-fielddb-authentication json="authentication"></div>
```

To show an import widget:

_Also, some default caveats of a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) project: if you edit files in the "dist" subdirectory you will be sadly dissapointed, as they are generated via Gulp. The source code in the "src" subdirectory._

* Run the tests `$ npm install` and  `$ bower install` and `$ gulp test` it should say something like `Finished 'test' after 3.54 s` And show how long each step `jshint` `test` `karma:unit` `dist` and `cssmin` took to run. If any of these parts errors, ask us for help in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/FieldDB/FieldDB/issues).
