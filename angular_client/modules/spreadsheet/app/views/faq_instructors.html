<h1 class="">FAQ for Instructors</h1>

<div class="question " >When should my students start using LingSync?</div>
<div class="answer " >You as the instructor will ideally register and create a database by the beginning of the class, so that your students can register within the first few weeks. You can make a new account by going to the <a href="http://app.lingsync.org"> LingSync app</a>, and create a corpus by logging in, hovering over 'Settings', and selecting 'Corpus', where you will have the option of creating a new corpus. Once your students have registered, you can add them to your database by going to the "Admin" features .This way, they will have signed up and familiarized themselves with the database by the time you have discussed phonetics and the phonemic inventory.</div>

<div class="answer " >Before you let students start entering data into your corpus, it may be helpful to provide them with glossing conventions (e.g. the Leipzig glossing rules). While they will certainly gloss some lexical entries incorrectly in the beginning, it will facilitate the searching process, and therefore ultimately the cleaning process, of glosses in your data. </div>


<div class="question " >What constitues an elicitation sessions?</div>
<div class="answer " >Each elicitation session in real life usually corresponds to an elicitation session in the app. If students have their own elicitation sessions outside of the classroom, it may also be helpful for them to enter their name (and potentially the date of elicitation) alongside the elicitation goal, so that they can easily find their own sessions to be cleaned. This will also facilitate the evaluation of progress for individual students. </div>


<div class="question " >What should students do if they find mistakes in their own or other students' data?</div>
<div class="answer " >When students find mistakes in their own data and are confident about fixing them, they may directly edit the data in question, which will generate a record of the change on the right of each edited datum below the "Edit" button. However, if students find mistakes in other students' data, it is recommended that they comment on the relevant data, rather than changing it themselves. This way, students can discuss differences in their glosses without irreversably changing data, since once data has been changed, the LingSync team has to be contacted to change them back to an earlier version. A video on how to create comments under a datum in lingsync can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fvGxm7LoU"> here</a>.</div>
