  You can import entire Elicitation Session by uploading an audio/video (any format works: .wav, .aiff, .mp3, .ogg, .mov, .avi, .3gp, .mp4 etc) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcsdPyYEMFc&list=PLUrH6CNxFDrMtraL8hTLbLsQwdw1117FT">(how-to video)</a>.

</div>

<div class="question">
How much audio/video can I upload?
</div>
<div class="answer">
We set the limit at 1.5GB. If this is too low for you, you probably are doing a lot with audio/video and maybe even your department has a server that you can install the audio service on so that you dont have to use the LingSync.org resources. If you will have a lot of heavy video files (more than 300MB) you can also consider using a private or unlisted videos on YouTube, SoundCloud, Google drive or even your department's servers to host the files online.

<div class="question">
Can I share just an elicitation session, not a whole corpus?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  If you want to share a elicitation session with someone, you should <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18KcT_SO8YxG8QNlHValEztGmFpEc4-ZrjWO76lm0mUQ/viewform">send us an email</a> to say which session you want to share. We will send you a web widget that accesses only data in that session and lets the user log into that widget to read (if they are allowed) and/or edit (if they are allowed) data. You must put the widget in your own website and/or WordPress blog and provide the url to the user(s). If the user does not have read access on your corpus, you can to provide us with their username(s) so we can add conditional permissions to their account.
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I have multiple languages in one corpus?
</div>
<div class="answer">
   LingSync supports multilingual corpora, as a user you can put anything you wish into a corpus (depending on what makes sense for your own research). Multilingual corpora are very useful, and very common for crosslinguistic studies of linguistic phenomen (for example a cross-linguistic study of applicatives).
</div>

<div class="question">
If I have multiple languages in a corpus, what would happen to the semi-automatic glosser?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  The semi-auto glosser learns from the context where a morpheme appears, so most often a corpus will rarely have a morpheme that appears in both languages in the same context. This means that a corpora can be multilingual, and still have a reasonaly usable semi-automatic glosser.
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I combine corpora?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  Yes, you can combine corpora. If you want to combine corpora you should <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18KcT_SO8YxG8QNlHValEztGmFpEc4-ZrjWO76lm0mUQ/viewform">send us an email</a> to tell us the names of the corpora to combine, and where to combine them to. We will verify that you have permission to do this, and do the combining and testing of the result.
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I combine glossers from multiple corpora?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  By default, each corpus has its own glosser fed by the data in that corpus. If you have many corpora that you want to feed one glosser, (for example two or more Quechua corpora), or one master corpus with a few smaller corpora which can use the master's glosser, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18KcT_SO8YxG8QNlHValEztGmFpEc4-ZrjWO76lm0mUQ/viewform">send us an email</a> and tell us which corpora should feed which glosser and we will set up the glosser for you, provide you with more instructions.
</div>

<div class="question">
I have my own glosser for the language I work on, can I use it?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  Yes, you can use any glosser as long as it is wrapped in a "webservice." <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18KcT_SO8YxG8QNlHValEztGmFpEc4-ZrjWO76lm0mUQ/viewform">Send us an email</a> and we will provide you with more instructions depending on the technology your glosser was implemented in.
