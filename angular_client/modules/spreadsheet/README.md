# Spreadsheet 

An app which was originally a student project, built in a few months using Angular before it came out of beta. Since then this has become the most popular inteface for the app because it is very easy to understand and only offeres a few features which students in a field methods class need. Over time we have updated it to newer versions of angular and a newer architecture using Yeoman but the app remains a student project and is *not following software engineering nor angular best practices* so we dont reccomend basing future apps on the behaviour of this app.

## Getting Started

To maintain this app you should first go to the root of the repo and run `$ grunt travis` this will download and compile all dependancies for this app, and run the tests and build the minified version. With out this step you wil only be testing updates to the spreadsheet app, not updates to the entire app. 

Terminal tab one:
```bash
$ cd $FIELDDB_HOME
$ grunt travis
$ grunt watch

```

Terminal tab one:
```bash
$ cd $FIELDDB_HOME/angular_client/modules/core
$ grunt watch

```

Terminal tab three:
```bash
$ cd $FIELDDB_HOME/angular_client/modules/core
$ grunt serve

```
The final `$ grunt serve` will open up your default browser with this app running so you can begin developing the app. We usually use Chrome as our default browser, and use CMD+Shift+J to open the Chrome developer tools to do break pointing in the app.

_Some default caveats of a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) project: if you edit files in the "dist" subdirectory you will be sadly dissapointed, as they are generated via Grunt. The source code in the "app" subdirectory._
