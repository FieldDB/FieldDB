<div class="question">
How do I import data?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  You can import entire Elicitation Session by uploading an audio/video (any format works: .wav, .aiff, .mp3, .ogg, .mov, .avi, .3gp, .mp4 etc) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcsdPyYEMFc&list=PLUrH6CNxFDrMtraL8hTLbLsQwdw1117FT">(how-to video)</a>. 
or text data (csv, plain text, TextGrid, toolbox and more)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcc0CFhGLfI&list=PLUrH6CNxFDrMtraL8hTLbLsQwdw1117FT">(how-to video)</a> using the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lingsync-prototype/eeipnabdeimobhlkfaiohienhibfcfpa">Prototype app</a>. These import functionality will be moved to the corpus admin pages when it becomes a priority.
</div>

<div class="question">
How can I reduce my audio/video upload size?
</div>
<div class="answer">
If you have heavy video files (more than 300MB) you should consider using a private or unlisted video on YouTube, SoundCloud, Google drive or even your department's servers to host the file online. You can still import the audio/video into LingSync by extracting just the audio track and uploading it. FFmpeg makes it easy to convert any audio/video to mp3. <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html">Download FFmpeg</a> and put it in the same directory as your video (or install it on your system if you know how). FFmpeg is very very useful for linguists so its a great tool to have on your computer. After you have it, then open a terminal/console and type something like this:

<pre>cd folderwheremyvideofilesare</pre>
<pre>ffmpeg -i myoriginalvideofilename.mp4 myoriginalvideofilename.mp3</pre>
(where mp4 is the original file type)
