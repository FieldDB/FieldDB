How do I export data?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  You can export your entire database as <a target="_blank" href="{{server}}/{{DB.pouchname}}/_design/pages/_list/asCSV/get_datum_fields">csv</a> (warning, csv is a lossy format, don't use this for backing up your data), or backup your data as non-lossy <a target="_blank" href="{{server}}/{{DB.pouchname}}/_design/pages/_view/get_datum_fields">json</a>. You can also share your data with other people by adding them to your corpus, or you can make parts of your corpus public and sharable on <a target="_blank" href="http://lingsync.org/{{DB.pouchname.replace('-','/')}}">your corpus' own webpage</a> You can also export lists of data in LaTeX using the <a target="_blank" href="https://corpus.lingsync.org/public-firstcorpus/_design/pages/corpus.html">Prototype app</a>.
