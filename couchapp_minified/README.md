This is the couchapp which contains the assets to deploy a minified version of fielddb to a couch. This allows you to deploy fielddb to any database of your choosing, online without the need for CORS support on your couchdb.

To build the app into this minified couchapp run:

    $ cd FieldDB
    $ bash scripts/build_fielddb_minified.sh
