This is the backbone client, where most of the code base was in 2012. Since then we have ported this code to [CommonJS](https://github.com/FieldDB/FieldDB/tree/master/api) so that it can be used in any Javascript framework.

You can see the Prototype in action by installing it from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lingsync-prototype/eeipnabdeimobhlkfaiohienhibfcfpa?authuser)

You can run this code in 3 ways:

## Chrome Extension  

If you want to debug the app, this is the best way to go. You can modify the source, refresh the browser and you have the new code. To install this app go to chrome://chrome/extensions, check
'developer mode', then click on 'Load unpacked extensions...' and
select the subfolder _attachments here.

If you get a blank black screen, look at the developer console and if it says

Failed to load resource chrome-extension://chpphlmbdnlddgbhiplfpolgfhpadfip/libs/compiled_handlebars.js

you will need to go to the top level folder (above this folder), do

    $ cd FieldDB
    $ npm install
    $ bash scripts/build_templates.sh

(you need to do this only once when you first download the codebase, and run build_templates.sh every time you change the handlebars templates)


## CouchApp

If you want to deploy the app so that it can run online on URL, the fastest way is to push it to a couchdb.
You can use the map_reduce_data folder and the build_debug.sh script, or the couchapp_minified folder, and the build_fielddb_minified.sh script.

## Android App

If you want to run the app as an Native Android app you can use the AndroidFieldDB project, combined with the build_release_android.sh script. 

Running on Android is farely complex as it requires you to set up 5 Android libraries, 3 for TouchDB (a local http server which implements the couchdb API) and 2 for OPrime (an offline Android data management/psycholinguistics experimentation library).
