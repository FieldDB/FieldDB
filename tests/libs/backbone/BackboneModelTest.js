/*
 * 
 * Spies are functions that keep track of how and often they were called, and what values were returned. This is phenomenally useful in asynchronous and event-driven applications as you can send a spy function off to keep track of whatâ€™s going on inside your methods, even if those methods are anonymous or closed off from direct inspection.
