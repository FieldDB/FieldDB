/**
 * @class Permissions
 * @name  Permissions
 *
 * @description A collection of open ended permissions which can be applied to any object
 * (usually a corpus, but could be a datalist, or datum, or datumField). A permission
 * can be thought of roughly as a phrase:
 * <pre>
 *
 * User [{username: "lingllama", gravatar: "123"}]
 * has permission ["admin","write","read","comment","export","import",etc]
 * to "corpus"/"datalist"/"datum"/"datumField"
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * @property {Permission} admins Users who can perform admin operations on the corpus/datalist/datum/datumField.
 * @property {Permission} exporters Users who can export the items in a corpus/datalist/datum/datumField.
 * @property {Permission} writers Users who can modify the items in a corpus/datalist/datum/datumField.
 * @property {Permission} commenters Users who can comment on the items in a corpus/datalist/datum/datumField.
 * @property {Permission} readers Users who can read the items in a corpus/datalist/datum/datumField.
 *
 * @property {Object} viewAsBasePermissionSystem  This is just syntactic sugar which points to the actual
 *    permission system. The actual permission system should be used by apps who want provide a power user or
 *    fine grained and open ended control over the permissions, or whose users want to understand
 *    the fine graned control at a lower level.
 *    - Kind of like Unix permissions.
 * @property {Object} viewAsDataBasePermissionSystem This is syntactic sugar which makes
 *    the permission system look like there is an implicative relationship betwween roles.
 *    - Kind of like PhP/MySQL systems.
 * @property {Object} viewAsGroupedPermissionSystem This is syntactic sugar which shows users in
 *    only one category (readOnly, writeOnly, read/write, admins) it also makes
 *    the permission system look like there is an implicative relationship betwween roles, but with some hint that
 *    there are some rare roles (such as write only) for crowdsourcing/non-standard data entry contexts.
 *    - Kind of like PhP/MySQL systems.
 * @property {Object} viewAsEmailingTeamPermissionSystem This might be the way that
 *    some computational linguistics teams will understand the permission system best,
 *    but the words `collaborator` and `contributor` are so similar that thus far no one
 *    has used these terms (that we know of).
 *    - Kind of like GitHub.
