/**
 * @class The CorpusMask is saved as corpus in the Couch repository,
 *        it is the publicly visible version of a corpus. By default it just says "This
 *        corpus is private," when users decide to make some aspects of their corpsu
 *        public they can customize the fields in their "corpus" object to display
 *        only certain sorts of data, even though the corpus is publicly discoverable.
 *
 * @property {String} title This is the title of the corpus, as set by the corpus
 *           team. It can contain any UTF-8 character.
 * @property {String} titleAsUrl This is what appears in the url on the main website.
 *           It is based on the title of the corpus and can be changed and looks
 *           nicer than the dbname which cannot be changed. eg
 *           http://fieldlinguist.com/LingLlama/SampleFieldLinguisticsCorpus
 * @property {String} description This is a short description that
 *           appears on the corpus details page
 * @property {Object} termsOfUse Terms of use set by the corpus team, includes
 *           a field for humanReadable terms which are displayed on the corpus
 *           and included in corpus exports.
 * @property {Object} license License set by the corpus team, includes a field
 *           for humanReadable terms which are displayed on the corpus and
 *           included in corpus exports, as well as a link to the license, imageUrl
 *           for the image/logo of the license for easy recognition and
 *           title of the license.
 * @property {Object} copyright Who owns the copyright to the corpus,
 *           by default it is set to the corpus team's name but teams can customize
 *           it for example to make the corpus copyright of the language community
 *           or speakers who contributed to the corpus.
 * @property {Object} location GPS location of the corpus (longitude, latitude and accuracy)
 *           The corpus can be plotted on a map using the accuracy as a radius
 *           of roughly where the data is from.
 * @property {String} remote The url of the remote eg:
 *           git@fieldlinguist.com:LingLlama/SampleFieldLinguisticsCorpus.git
 * @property {Array} couchConnections The url of couch remote(s) where the
 *           corpus is replicated or backed up.
 * @property {Array} olacConnections The url of OLAC remote(s) where the corpus
 *           is archived or published.
 *
 * @property {Array} members Collection of public browsable/search engine
 *           discoverable members associated to the corpus
 * @property {Array} datumstates Collection of datum states for which data are
 *           will be public browsable/search engine discoverable in the corpus. This
 *           can be used to only show polished data or "checked" data on the public
 *           page for example.
 * @property {Array} datumfields Collection of datum fields which will be
 *           public browsable/search engine discoverable  on public datum in the corpus
 * @property {Array} sessions Collection of public browsable/search engine
 *           discoverable sessions that belong to the corpus
 * @property {Array} datalists Collection of public browsable/search engine
 *           discoverable data lists created under the corpus
 *
