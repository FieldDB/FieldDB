A Contributor may be a person, an organization, or a service—any entity that has sufficient involvement in the creation or development of the resource to warrant explicit identification. A term from olac:role should be used to specify the role of the Contributor. Contributor is related to Creator since many of the terms in the role vocabulary (like author or photographer) name the role of the primary creator of a resource. The OLAC recommendation is that Contributor (with the appropriate role designation) be used in these cases, and that Creator be used only when there is not an appropriate term in the olac:role vocabulary for the role played by the entity that created the resource. A participating OLAC repository need not be concerned about the fact that other metadata services based on Dublin Core may prefer and even require the use of the Creator element. The OLAC-to-Simple-DC crosswalk built into the OLAC Aggregator automatically maps certain OLAC Contributor roles like author and photographer to the Creator element. See the discussion of Creator for more on its use. Follow the form in which the person's name would normally be listed in an alphabetical index in his or her own language or country of residence, e.g., “FamilyName, GivenName” for an English speaker.
