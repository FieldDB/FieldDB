  <p class="locale_user_settings_instructions">This is where you can
		adjust settings that are mostly for you as a user, that aren't really
		tied to a corpus. Your settings are backed up when you authenticate
		with the server (this usually happens when the "I need to make sure its you" box pops up) so that you can get your preferences if you log in on
		another device.</p>

  <div class="border-bottom">
		<h5 class = "locale_Skin"> </h5>
		<p class="locale_skin_instructions">You can use a combinations of background colors or pictures,
			and transparency to create the entire range between high contrast, to low contrast, low eyestrain screens
			to make it easier on your eyes to enter data for long periods of
			time. You can also keep the background picture on random if you feel
			it might help you stop procrastinating and enter your data.</p>

		<p class="locale_number_datum_instructions">You can change the number
			of datum in the data entry area of your dashboard, if you like to
			enter data surrounded by context (ie see the datum that you just
			entered as you would in Word or Excel), you can set it to a high
			number (5). This can be confusing because the datum are inserted at
			the top, not at the bottom of the data entry area (if this annoys
			you, let us know using the bug form, it probably woudlnt take long to make it into an option.)
			</p>
			<p> You can
			also have the app show only one datum, and even make that datum full
			screen using the arrows in its widget (if you like to enter data like
			you would in FileMaker Pro). A pretty good middle ground is 2 datum visible. With two datum 
			you can see when you are creating minimal pairs, or creating new datum  
			to be checked with a language consultant, based on an existing datum.</p>
