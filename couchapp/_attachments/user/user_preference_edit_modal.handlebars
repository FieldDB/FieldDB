			to make it easier on your eyes to enter data for long periods of
			time. You can also keep the background picture on random if you feel

			to enter data surrounded by context (ie see the datum that you just
			entered as you would in Word or Excel), you can set it to a high
			number (5). This can be confusing because the datum are inserted at
			the top, not at the bottom of the data entry area (if this annoys
			you, let us know using the bug form, it probably woudlnt take long to
			make it into an option.)</p>
		<p>You can also have the app show only one datum, and even make
			that datum full screen using the arrows in its widget (if you like to
			enter data like you would in FileMaker Pro). A pretty good middle
			ground is 2 datum visible. With two datum you can see when you are
			creating minimal pairs, or creating new datum to be checked with a
			language consultant, based on an existing datum.</p>
