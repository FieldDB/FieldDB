     * 
     * @property {Date} lastListened This is the date of the last time the student listened to this Exercise
     * 
     * @property {RecordArray} recordings This is the array of all the recordings made by the student
     * each recording will have an accuracyRating (a percentage saying how close to the student's recording is compared to the Datum's sound)
     * each recording will have privacy settings to be determined by the student
     * each recording will say who recorded it
     * each recording will say what date it was recorded
     * the RecordArray will tell us how many recordings it has in it.
     * 
     * @property {User} To be replaced by either student or teacher, but for the moment we just use User to get its ID.
	 * maybe we don't need User because it'd be in Session, which is in Datum.
	 * ? @property {String} student This is the ID of the student whose progress we're tracking
