			<h1>
				Your data is your data.
			</h1>
			<p>
				In the spirit of transparency we provide you with these templates of standard
				social web app privacy policies and terms of service to fully
				explain the data involved in LingSync.org. There are two types:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					data which is typical data that most social websites use to
					make sure their app is user friendly and to let users trust
					each other and collaborate, and
				</li>
				<li>
					data which is your fieldlinguistics data (your "Corpus")
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In both cases, we don't use your private data, we have no private data sharing 
				partnerships with third parties, and we will never have private data sharing partnerships with third parties. 
				In fact, we try to avoid collecting
				any sensitive private data about you. You can access your private data at any time, just ask us how.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>
					However
				</strong>
				: we are a team of Open Source volunteers,
				as such we have no legal team, no customer support team and we want
				you to know that LingSync.org and the software that runs on it  is provided AS IS, WITH NO
				WARRANTEE, NO FORMAL SUPPORT AND NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL OR WILL NOT DO ANYTHING.
				<a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/wiki/How-to-install-on-your-own-server">
					If you are worried about these things, we prefer that you set
					up your own private  server so that we don't have to worry
					about the legal implications of hosting your data.

										Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
									</h1>
									<p>
										This agreement was written in English (Canada). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.  Please note that Section 14 contains certain changes to the general terms for users outside Canada.
									</p>
									<p>
										Date of Last Revision: November 15, 2013.
									</p>
									<h2>
										Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
									</h2>
									<p>
										This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (“Statement,” “Terms,” or “SRR”) derives from the LingSync Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with LingSync. By using or accessing LingSync, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how LingSync works.
									</p>
									<h2>
										1. Privacy
									</h2>
									<p>
										Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our 
										<a href="#privacyI" target="_blank">
											Data Use Policy
										</a> to make important disclosures about how you can use LingSync to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information.  We encourage you to read the 
										<a href="#privacyI" target="_blank">
											Data Use Policy
										</a>, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
									</p>
									<h2>
										2. Sharing Your Content and Information
									</h2>
									<p>
										You own all of the content and information you post on LingSync, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											For content which you haved deamed as "shared content" with other users and/or the public at large, and which is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to provide access to any IP content that you post on or in connection with LingSync (IP License). This IP License applies only to data which you have "shared" with other users and/or the public at large. You are in control of which data is "shared". By default none of your data is "shared;" sharing your data is opt-in only. This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
										</li>
										<li>
											When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
										</li>
										<li>
											LingSync.org is an open ended plugin system which is composed of numerous applications. When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Infrastructure, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our 
											<a href="#privacyI" target="_blank">
												Data Use Policy
											</a> and Infrastructure Page.)
										</li>
										<li>
											When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of LingSync, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
										</li>
										<li>
											We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about LingSync, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
										</li>
									</ol>
									<h2>
										3. Safety
									</h2>
									<p>
										We do our best to keep LingSync safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep LingSync safe, which includes the following commitments by you:
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on LingSync.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not collect users’ content or information, or otherwise access LingSync, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our prior permission.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on LingSync.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related, dating or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on LingSync.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not use LingSync to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of LingSync, such as a denial of service attack or interference with page rendering or other LingSync functionality.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<h2>
										4. Registration and Account Security
									</h2>
									<p>
										Thus far most LingSync users use their actual identities, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											You will not provide any false personal information on LingSync, or create an account for anyone (including famous linguists) other than yourself without their permission.
										</li>
										<li>
											If you register an account for someone else without their knowledge, or an account for a fictional persona, we reserve the right to disable this account.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not create more than one personal account.
										</li>
										<li>
											If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.
										</li>
										<li>
											In the eventuality that you need to reset your password, or we have identified your account as fictional, you must keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not share your password or let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.
										</li>
										<li>
											If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user’s actual name).
										</li>
									</ol>
									<h2>
										5. Protecting Other People’s Rights
									</h2>
									<p>
										We respect other people’s rights, and expect you to do the same.
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											You will not post content or take any action on LingSync that infringes or violates someone else’s rights or otherwise violates the law.
										</li>
										<li>
											We can remove any content or information you post on LingSync if we believe that it violates this Statement or our policies.
										</li>
										<li>
											If we remove your content for infringing someone else’s copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.
										</li>
										<li>
											If you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including LingSync, the LingSync logs), or any confusingly similar marks, except with our prior written permission.
										</li>
										<li>
											If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not LingSync) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not post anyone’s identification documents or private information on LingSync.
										</li>
										<li>
											You will not send email invitations to non-users without their consent.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<h2>
										6. Mobile and Other Devices

									<p>
										We provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier’s normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply.
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											You provide consent and all rights necessary to enable users to sync (including through an application) their devices with any information that is visible to them on LingSync.

									</ol>
									<h2>

										</li>
										<li>
											You give us permission to use and allow others to use such content on LingSync.
										</li>
										<li>
