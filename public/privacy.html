			<h1>Your data is your data.</h1>

			<p>In the spirit of transparency we provide you with these templates of standard
				social web app privacy policies and terms of service to fully
				explain the data involved in LingSync.org. There are two types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>data which is typical data that most social websites use to
					make sure their app is user friendly and to let users trust
					each other and collaborate, and</li>
				<li>data which is your fieldlinguistics data (your "Corpus")</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In both cases, we don't use your private data, and we have no
				partnerships with third parties. In fact, we try to avoid collecting
				any sensitive private data about you. We would also be happy to give
				you your private data, just request it.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>However</strong> : we are a team of Open Source volunteers,
				as such we have no legal team, no customer support team and we want
				you to know that LingSync.org and the software that runs on it  is provided AS IS, WITH NO
				WARENTEE, NO FORMAL SUPPORT AND NO GUARENTEE THAT IT WILL OR WILL
				NOT DO ANYTHING. <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/wiki/How-to-install-on-your-own-server">If you are worried about these things, we prefer that you set
				up your own private  server so that we don't have to worry
				about the legal implications of hosting your data.</a>

								<p>You hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold us, our
									business partners, third-party suppliers and providers,

									agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from
									and against any damages, losses, liabilities, settlements, and
									expenses (including without limitation costs and reasonable
									attorneys’ fees) in connection with any claim or action that
									(i) arises from any alleged breach by you of this Agreement or
									any representations, warranties and/or covenants contained
									herein, (ii) arises from the Content or effects of any messages
									you distribute using our Service, or (iii) otherwise arises
									from or relates to your use of our Service. In addition, you
									acknowledge and agree that the Indemnified Parties have the
									right to seek damages when you use our Service for unlawful
									purposes, in an unlawful manner, and/or in a manner
									inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and that such
									damages may include, without limitation, direct, indirect,
									special, incidental, cover, reliance and/or consequential
									damages.</p>

								<h3 id="IX">IX. Electronic communications</h3>
								<p>You consent to receive communications from us
									electronically. We will communicate with you by e-mail to your
									registered email address or by posting notices on this site.
									You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other
									communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy
									any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>

								<h3 id="X">X. Feeds</h3>

									and services via RSS feeds; for the purposes of these terms,
									such access constitutes use of the Website and services. We ask
									that you use these features respectfully. You may not use these
									or any other features or the Website itself to allow the
									display of a substantial portion of the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
									database or reproduce, duplicate or copy the Website. We
									reserve the rights to change these features at any time and to
									disable access to the feeds and the API at any time for any
									reason.</p>

								<h3 id="XI">XI. Governing law; Dispute resolution</h3>
								<p>A. In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes,
									you and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX agree that any legal or equitable
									claim relating to these Terms (referred to as a “Claim”) will
									be resolved as follows:</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Informal Resolution.</strong> You and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
									agree that we will first try to resolve any Claim informally.
									Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding for at
									least 30 days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in
									writing. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX will send its notice to your email
									address. You will send your notice to hello@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Arbitration.</strong> Please read this carefully.&nbsp;
									It affects your rights.&nbsp; XXXXXXXXXXXXXX and you (such
									references include our respective predecessors in interest,
									successors and assigns) agree to arbitrate all disputes and
									claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement between
									XXXXXXXXXXXXXX and you.&nbsp; The arbitration shall be
									governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and
									the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
									(collectively, “AA Rules”) of the American Arbitration
									Association (“AA”), as modified by this Agreement, and shall be
									administered by the AA.&nbsp; All issues are for the arbitrator
									to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but
									the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp;
									Except as otherwise provided for herein, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX will
									pay all AA filing, administration and arbitrator fees.&nbsp;
									If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
									your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted,
									as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
									Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be
									governed by the AA Rules.&nbsp; In such case, you agree to
									reimburse XXXXXXXXXXXXXX for all monies previously disbursed
									by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AA
									Rules. &nbsp;If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is
									equal to or greater than the value of your Demand,
									XXXXXXXXXXXXXX shall reimburse you for your reasonable
									attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred for the
									arbitration.&nbsp; You agree that, by entering into this
									Agreement, you and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX are waiving the right to a
									trial by jury.
								</p>
								<p>You and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX agree that YOU AND
									XXXXXXXXXXXXXX MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
									YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff or
									class member in any purported class or representative
									proceeding. Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not
									consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and
									may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
									class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to
									be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause
									shall be null and void.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Formal Resolution.</strong> If we cannot resolve a
									Claim informally, you and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX each agree to
									submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and agree that any
									and all Claims either of us asserts shall be exclusively
									brought in the appropriate state or federal court in the
									Southern District of the State of New York, provided that
									neither you nor XXXXXXXXXXXXXX shall be precluded from
									filing a Claim in small claims court for disputes within the
									small claims court jurisdictional level.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Governing Law and Jurisdictional Issues.</strong> This
									Agreement is governed in all respects by the substantive laws
									of the State of New York and of the United States of America.
									The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
									Goods is expressly disclaimed. Those who choose to access the
									Website from other locations do so on their own initiative and
									are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the
									extent local laws are applicable. Access to the Website from
									any territory where the content is illegal is prohibited. You
									may not use or export any of the Website materials in violation
									of U.S. export laws and regulations.
