     *        decide. They an make each state have a color so that the team can
     *        see quickly if there is something that needs to be done with that
     *        data. We also added an optional field, Consultant that they can use
     *        to say who they want to check with in case they have mulitple
     *        consultants and the consultants have different grammaticality
     *        judgements. When users change the state of the datum, we will add
     *        a note in the datum's comments field so that the history of its
     *        state is kept in an annotated format.
