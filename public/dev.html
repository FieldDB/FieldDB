		<h1>June 22 2012 - Week 9 - Search and security between black
			boxes is started</h1>

		<h2>Datum fields and datum states are adaptable to your corpus</h2>
		<p>This we we moved from hard coded datum fields and states that
			we were using while scaffolding out backone, to truely being able to
			decide on datum fields and datum states by the corpus administrator</p>

		<h2>LaTeX looking Data lists</h2>
		<p>Datalists are showing data in a LaTeX way (ie, the glosses and
			words are all properly aligned so you can read the examples in a
			quick glance)</p>

		<h2>Search: intersection or union</h2>
		<p>Intersection search and Union search are working. Users can
			search using any of the datum fields.</p>

		<h2>Moving to EC2: Amazon Elastic Cloud</h2>

		<p>Heroku seems to want us to pay 20$ a month to use https (a
			secure connection). So we switched to EC2 which we expected to do
			anyway since heroku is more expensive (it is a platform as a service,
			probably built off of EC2 or a similar cloud)</p>


		<h2>Securing Authentication and Database</h2>
		<p>This week we worked on getting EveryAuth to work. EveryAuth is
			a node module built on top of OAuth which allows users to log in
			using their other accounts, so that we have no password info for
			them, and they don't have another password to remember. We also
			worked on locking down the database and getting new users into the
			database via the authentication hook, not just via backbone.</p>

		<p>In this video Hisako explains what happens when the user clicks
			"Sync," and how we insure that data are not modified without proper
			permissions. Similar to offline games, we "replay" the edits on the
			server to be sure that no one with unauthorized access can modify the
			central database. What this means is that if the users have been able
			to download the data while they were offline, they can edit it, but
			they wont be able to sync (ie share their edits) unless they have the
			proper permissions.</p>

		<p>In this video we look at what happens when a new user comes to
			the app, and how we let them play with Sapir's sample data until they
			feel like making their own corpus.</p>

		<h1>June 15 2012 - Week 8 - Prettifying and getting all the Views
			in place, and a new Name!</h1>

		<img src="images/team_at_work.jpg" width="800" />
		<p>This week continued much from last week. We also prettified the
			app, using Bootstrap by Twitter, a framework for cute buttons, icons
			and fonts. There is still the import and search user stories to
			complete and modules to connect. We connected the modules to PouchDB,
			the portable offline version of CouchDB. We are still working on
			getting the Offline corpus to work on Android using TouchDB. As far
			as we know, we are the 3rd large project to use TouchDB, it's
			implementation of CouchDB might not even be complete so we might have
			to help them out so that we can use it. The PouchDB folks have also
			found out we were watching them and have also been implementing
			things around the clock. The database that PouchDB is using
			(IndexedDB) is an HTML5 specification that wasn't even implemented
			until 6 months ago in December. We are using a special advance
			developers version of Chrome that will be availible only in August,
			when we launch. Talk about being on the bleeding-edge of development!</p>

		<p>
			In addition, this week we created a new folder entitled <a
				href="https://github.com/iLanguage/iField/tree/master/docs">docs</a>
			which contains files that are designed to help those interested who
			want to use this project for their data collection and need a
			methodology section for their grant (or want to add a programming
			budget to their grant app to finish the "dream modules").

		</p>
		<p>
			If you're a fieldlinguist and you are curious about our app, these
			docs are for you. You can get either the .pdf or the .tex files. In
			these files, you will find information about our goals and
			objectives, evaluation metrics, and estimations of time and cost. <a

		<h2>Making Data Fields and Session Fields that truely adapt to
			your data</h2>
		<p>We also stated the refactor (the re-doing) of the Datums and
			Sessions. Here is Hisako explaining how the Datums and Sessions will
			"learn" and adapt to the team that is building their corpus.</p>

		<h1>June 8 2012 - Week 7 - Connecting the modules</h1>
		<p>This week implemented more views and clarify the connections
			between different modules. We started with what Emmy coined
			"boardcasts" showing the control flow for 3 different "User Stories."
			We have begun refactoring the site to reflect the ER diagram.
			Additionally, we connected our modules to IrisCouch, a hosting
			service for databases (a couch in cloud, it costs $1 per gigabite per
			month). In addition, we implemented pagination for the datalist view.</p>

		<h2>Paginator and the DataListView Sequence Diagram</h2>

		<p>Here is a boardcast about the sequence of events happening in
			the paginator with explaination in terms of the DataList for our
			application. DataLists are like favorites where users can put
			together a list of datum for a special purpose like creating a
			handout for a conference, or a list of data to prepare for a session
			with a consultant etc. DataLists can be pretty big, so we need to
			"paginate" them. we have decided to paginate them by sorting the most
			recent first.</p>

		<h2>Getting from Handlebars to the App</h2>

		<p>In implementing the connection between views and modules we
			want to start fleshing out the views with handlebars and integrating
			them into the app. This video will start you out with your handlebars
			template and takes you through backbone to finally render the view.

		<h1>June 1 2012 - Week 6 - Testing the modules</h1>
		<p>
			This week we set up the corpus database using CouchDB hosted on
			IrisCouch and wrote more testing code which specifies what functions
			the module must complete. Tests serve as <a href="">documentation</a>
			for what each class (you can think of classes as module) does. Tests
			also serve as sample client code for future developers when they want
			to use the modules, they can look at the module's tests to how to use
			the module's functionality.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also set up a testing environment for embedding widgets such as
			{DataList Widget, Data Search Widget, Activity Feed Widget} <a
				href="http://ilanguage.ca/about/about-ilanguage-lab/fieldlinguistics-web-widgets/">into
				a WordPress post</a>. Note, the testing post is private, use password
			"fieldlinguistics" to see it. The web widgets will allow linguists to
			let others interact with their data on their blogs.
		</p>
		<p>We have an initial implementation of ActivityFeeds, Datum
			Menus, the Lexicon indexer and the Confidentiality encryption using
			the AES encryption standard approved by the US Federal Government.</p>
		<p>We wrapped up the week with a cleaned up diagram for how the
			modules are related, in the form of an Entity Relationship Diagram.</p>
