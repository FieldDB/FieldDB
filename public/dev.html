		<h1>Dec 22 2012 - Week 34 &amp; 35 - New navigation bar and many
			bug fixes!</h1>


		<h2>No more notifications, and a new Customize menu in the nav
			bar</h2>
		<p>Spurred by a kick in the butt by our favorite beta tester, we
			fixed the nav bar. It was broken since the day it was created, back
			in June but it never hit our top priority. We upgraded our Twitter
			Bootstrap (a library to make user interfaces), jQuery, which made the
			update of the navbar obligatory as it was finally visually broken.</p>

		<p>We also moved all the notifications into a hidden area, where
			you can see them if you want to, but if you dont want to they will
			just pile up hidden from view.
		<p>
		<h2>Audit of the Activity creation</h2>

		<p>In preparation for finally moving the activity feeds into
			widgets (as they were originally designed), we moved all the activity
			creation to a central function on the app, which will either make
			offline activities if needed or post the activities directly to the
			master couch so that the teams can get instant popups/notifications
			other about what everyone else is doing.</p>


		<h2>Preparation for continuous sync</h2>

		<p>We designed the app so that it had a button to sync, it didn't
			sync continuously. But if you're working in a team, in the same room
			at the same time, and you don't have continuous sync on, you are
			likely to get merge conflicts on sessions and datalists and corpora.
			(and even datum if you are in the process or reviewing/cleaning
			rather than creating). To make it easier for teams to collaborate in
			real time we are adding a mode to the app that does continuous
			real-time replication. This is technically possible with pouch, it
			will just attempt to replicate, if it fails it will try again later.
			We'll keep you posted on how it goes...</p>


		<h2>New Activity Feed Widgets</h2>

		<p>We have started some new widgets (complete with build and
			minification, and embedability in WordPress sites). The development
			is going great, so far we have the code running, minifing and
			embedded into the app. Our next steps are to make the widgets
			customizable via routers, and have them poll for new activities every
			once in a while (most likley configurable in the routers)</p>

		<p>To run a widget on an external website (outside a chrome
			extension) the user has to simply embed an iFrame, just like they
			would embed a youtube video. We expect to serve the iframe from the
			users' activity feed or teams activity feed's couch were it wont face
			CORS blocking by iriscouch. To make this happen our plan is to add a
			checkbox in the app somewhere which says "allow public users to see
			my/our activity feed." We will be testing the activity feed widgets
			with the Mi'gmaq team over the coming weeks.</p>

		<h1>Dec 8 2012 - Week 32 &amp; 33 - New conversations</h1>
		<p>This week we started drafting up a new conversation module, it
			will allow you to have multiple speaker with overlapping utterances.
			We are working a new visualization for this with a time axis and the
			possibility to replay the conversation.</p>


		<h2>The app runs on Android, and on IrisCouch.com!</h2>

		<p>We moved the app's files around so that it is now running out
			of a couchapp, what does this mean? It means the app is now running
			in a users corpus, as an attachment and has full access to the user
			data (if they log in as themselves) which means the app can
			potentially be used offline in Chrome and Firefox, outside a Chrome
			extension. We also tested running out of a touchdb on Android, which
			is also working. We had to change some things in the app to get it to
			work (font awesome icons and bootstrap dropdowns).</p>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<h1>Nov 24 2012 - Week 30 &amp; 31 - Multiple users on a corpus</h1>

		<p>This week we added the server side and client side code to
			finally let users add each other to their corpora as readers, writers
			or admins. Now, if someone shares their corpus with you and gives you
			certain privileges the server will email you to let you know, and
			tell you that you have to sync in order to bring this new corpus down
			to your local computer. This is a very exciting change and really
			makes the team activity feed have a purpose. We did a bit of testing
			so far:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Does the team activity feed show multiple users activities?
			</li>
			<li>If we click sync after receiving an email, do we
				automatically see the corpus that was newly added?</li>
			<li>If two users insert datum, can they see eachother's datum?</li>
			<li>If two users edit the same datum at the same time, what
				happens?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our conclusions is that yes, the plans we made for the teams
			and permissions are working, the datum from each user end up in the
			same corpus and on the other user's computer if both click sync to
			sync their local data with the team server. But, we get very odd
			behavior involving what is "most recent" for the datum. It might have
			to do with timestamps...</p>
		<p>We also have a pretty bad result with when users are editing a
			datum at the same time: it looks like right now, out of the box (we
			haven't even had time to look and see if there is a doc conflict
			error) each user sees only their version of that datum. Our hope is
			that Pouch is complaining and getting a document conflict error so we
			will be able to catch it, alert the user that there were two users
			who tried to edit the datum at the same time and then send them to
			the database admin panel on Futon to go and resolve the conflicts
			manually.</p>

		<h1 id="bugfixfiesta">Nov 10 2012 - Week 28 &amp; 29 - Bug fixing
			fiesta!</h1>
		<p>On the thrusdays of these two weeks we had a bug fixing fiesta
			to put out a new release in preparation for beta testing with a field
			methods class in January. We closed roughly 29 bugs, and opened over
			41!</p>

		<h2>Pressing enter is now enough</h2>
		<p>
			Some of the more exciting bugs we fixed were the ability to finally
			push enter when the app asks you to confirm that your identity <a
				href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/issues/559">#559</a>.
			This is something we had been looking forward to fixing for a long
			time but was rather tricky since the modal that pops up is not
			C-commanded by the authentication code. We had to move the code that
			captures key events on the password field up to the App level where
			it could c-command the modal.
		</p>

		<h2>Instructions iteration 2</h2>

		<p>We also started drafting a second iteration of much of the text
			instructions in the app, notably the search text and the quick start
			instructions.</p>

		<h2>Key word search joins field search</h2>
		<p>We finally added a bit of code to make it possible to do a
			datum wide key word search. If you now type something in the quick
			search box, it will search all the datum fields. Of course as before
			you can also specify that you want it to only search in the
			utterance, morphemes, gloss or semantic denotation fields etc.</p>

		<h2>An odd side effect</h2>
		<p>We found a pretty funny bug, if you enter something in a
			corpus, then create a new corpus you would automatically get the text
			you searched for as part of any new datum in that corpus. The reason
			for this is that the search page is composed of all the datum fields
			currently in your corpus, and if you have a search active when you
			leave the app, your search can be there when you come back. The odd
			text popping up in Datum was a side effect of this feature. We put in
			some code which copies a clean version of your datum and session
			fields when you make a new corpus. We will eventually need to add a
			way to remove a default datum field from corpora. At the moment if
			you have a corpus specialized for phonology, and then make one that
			you want to be specialized with datum fields for semantics, you will
			have all the fields that you had in the phonology corpus. Of course,
			we expect this to happen rarely since users will most likly have a
			set of fields they use for all their corpora.</p>


		<h2>LingLlama replaces Sapir as sample user</h2>

		<p>We had some complaints about Sapir as a person, so we contacted
			the LingLlama to see what he would think about letting us use the
			LingLlama as a sample user, he said sure. We are super excited to
			have a new sample user, one that is fictional!</p>

		<h2>Show me all my data!</h2>

		<p>We started working on an All Data button that would automate
			the process of searching your datum, creating a data list for you,
			titleing it with the date, saving it and making it full screen. This
			is one of the biggest mysteries when you open a field linguistics
			program, and one of the reasons people stop using it before they even
			start. If you can't see your data so you are wondering if the app is
			working. We have always planned that you should be able to see your
			data in one huge data list, and that when you open the app you have
			the last data you edited shown to you in the middle of the screen but
			this had some technical challenges behind it.</p>

		<p>The biggest instability in the app since we switched to having
			three main dashboards (a register page, a user page, a corpus page)
			was that you had to sync down from the server before you could use
			search. Why was this, you might ask? It has to do with views. Views
			are a "view" on your data in CouchDB/PouchDB terms. Essentially there
			are a couple of key views in the app that make it possible to find
			your most recent data, all your data, and all your activities. Since
			when we first built the app we didnt know how to create views on the
			PouchDB (local, offline database) we were making them on the server
			when we created a new user, this meant that before your user's
			dashboard was complete, you HAD to sync. Since very few users believe
			the sync button is necessary (they are working alone, and/or don't
			want to back up the data that is largely just them playing around
			with the app) these views weren't being created and so when the app
			tried to use them it was producing silent growns that the user had no
			idea about, unless they opened the console and looked.</p>

		<p>Over the weekend we sat down and took some careful time to
			figure out how to create the views using PouchDB locally, offline,
			when the views are needed. So, we now have a couple of new messages
			in the app that tell you when we are initializing search for the
			first time, or initializing the query/view that finds your most
			recent datum and puts it into the data entry widget for you.</p>


		<p>It is so exciting to have the app back to what it was doing for
			about 1-2 weeks in July, showing you all your data, and showing you
			your most recent data when you open the app.</p>

		<h2>Getting data entry to flow</h2>

		<p>Data entry so far in the app was mostly focused on import. We
			figured those that have data, are most curious about how hard it
			would be to switch to a new data management tool. Now that we are
			preparing for field methods, where we expect the users will actually
			be using some of the auto-completion of the app to enter data, we did
			an audit of how the data entry flow works.</p>

		<p>Some important questions were:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Can I tab through the data fields and get to the new datum
				button, and push enter?</li>
			<li>Can I immediately start typing if I create a new datum?</li>
			<li>Can I enter data without a mouse in a full screen view?</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			We went through all these use cases and made sure they worked. Oddly
			enough, the tabbing to the + New Datum button had some important
			consequences. The app is using something called a router. The router
			is a lot like a web url which you would see on a normal online app,
			except that it has a # which divides the part the server handles, and
			the part the client side app handles. The good thing about a router
			is that it allows users to book mark what appears to be a 'page' to
			them, ie import, or a datum, or a data list etc. By turning the new
			datum into a route, we can now link to it from many areas of the app,
			and we can cause the link functionality of the bootstrap
			<button class="btn btn-mini btn-primary">+</button>
			button to trigger the display of a new datum, complete with putting
			the cursor in the first field of the datum (an invaluable asset for a
			data entry app).
		</p>

		<h2>Auditing the Datum Save button</h2>
		<p>Originally we wanted to the app save datum every 10 seconds, so
			that the user wouldn't loose their work. Almost all our users found
			this didn't make sense, they would rather save the data by clicking
			on a button. If they don't click save, don't save.</p>

		<p>So, we added a save button in addition to saving every 10
			seconds. The save button was acting kind of oddly, sometimes saving,
			sometimes not. We took a look and saw that the button was only saving
			if the datum thought there had been changes to it, rather than saving
			directly to the database. We made the save but save 100% of the time,
			and commented out the code that saved the datum every 10 seconds. The
			app still saves the datum if it has been changed and falls of the
			datum entry area. We really need to think about this and re-design
			the save in a way that users like, rather than trying to reduce the
			number of versions in the database.</p>


		<h2>Breaking changes in corpus connections</h2>
		<p>The McGill server will have have a very special CouchDB
			configuration. To our knowledge this will be one of the rare times on
			the internet that a CouchDB will be running out of a directory
			(actually a virtual directory). The reason for this is that the
			University would prefer to route all traffic to the server through
			Apache, so that the traffic can be analyzed using their existing log
			monitoring systems. This is especially important for DOS (Denial of
			Service) attacks where malicious servers repeatedly contact a server
			for all its content in attempt to over load it and thereby "deny"
			service to anyone legitimately trying to use the server. What this
			means for CouchDB and Node.js, two technologies designed to have
			support for high concurrancy, and support lots of live connections is
			that they will be throtteled down to the speed and capacity of an
			Apache server. If this were the main LingSync server we would
			probably point this out to the University and tell them that they are
			being silly, but because we only expect about 5-10 people to use the
			server, and they wont connect very often we figure its not worth
			explaining to them the difference between Apache threaded connections
			and Erlang or Javascript event driven connections.</p>

		<p>To prepare for this change we added a path to all new corpus
			connections, and added code to make existing corpus connections
			compatible with the new server code (which is the same for the McGill
			server and the production and testing servers). We hope this wont
			introduce bugs, and whatever bugs there are we will catch them soon.
			We are going to wait about 2 weeks before we put the McGill server
			into production to see if there are bugs that we didn't catch in our
			internal testing.</p>


		<h2>The corpus-precendence-rules-visualization comes back</h2>
		<p>While we were in Guatemala between talks we were refactoring
			and cleaning up the handlebars to reduce the number of handlebars
			that had to be copy pasted to update menus when small changes or new
			buttons were added. The Corpus handlebars had roughly 6 minutely
			different versions which created a nightmare for localization. While
			we were reducing the 6 down to 2 we lost the div that held the corpus
			visualization! We didn't even notice it was gone until November. We
			traced back the commits, found it (it was just one line) and put it
			back in. Now its all working in is crazy flying glory. Its fun to
			have a data visualization, but hopefully someday soon someone will
			have time to change the visualization into something that actually
			has meaning for linguists, at the moment its just the linear locality
			of morphemes... not even arrows to indicate precedence.</p>

		<h2>Loading spinner for long data lists</h2>
		<p>Long data lists take about 10-50sec to load into memory,
			sometimes much more. We added a spinner that shows you the progress
			of loading your dashboard. Although not ideal at least this way the
			users know something is going on while the dashboard is loading.
			Before it used to say "untitled corpus" and that was the only
			indication that the dashboard hadn't finished loading.</p>


		<h2>Inserted columns in Import are droppable</h2>

		<p>
			Finally we found the bug that was making inserted columns in the
			import not be droppble, which was pretty odd behaviour and pretty
			annoying. It all came to a lack of "self," yeah no joke. In
			javascript, an object has a "this" which refers to itself, and lets
			it access its own member variables or functions. The code that was
			attempting to add the drop listeners to these inserted cells was
			using "this" but in a scope/closure where the this didn't mean the
			ImportView (the object that knew how to handle the drop event), but
			rather to the actual html element itself. The problem was easily <a
				href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/commit/171565f64e9150575496441de2a7b299b13cfd1f">fixed</a>
			by binding this to a new variable, outside the closure, and then
			referencing it inside the jQuery scope that was creating the html
			elements.

		<h1>October 27 2012 - Week 26 &amp; 27 - Localization for Android
			&amp; Web</h1>

		<h2>Localization made more general</h2>
		<p>When we first set up the localization we used the built in
			Chrome localization API, what this meant was that the app as of July
			30, no longer worked on the web or on Android. This week Elise braved
			regular expressions to a system wide find and replace so we could use
			a more general localization strategy, now the app can run on the web
			again!</p>

		<h2>Simplifying the import page</h2>

		<p>This week we also kept working on trying to make the import
			page simpler. The import hadn't been re-designed since the night it
			was hacked together in July for a pre-alpha demo, it needed some love
			:)</p>

		<h2>Production servers are live</h2>
		<p>Our new production services/servers are now live in the
			lingsync.org namespace. It took some time for the dns to resolve for
			all the components to come together. We are using Nginx to delegate
			the https connection to different node js web services on different
			ports. We released version 1.24 stable which is using the new
			permanent production servers. We're so excited that the app finally
			has a home and database that won't be moving any time soon!</p>

		<h2>New read-only corpus dashboards</h2>

		<p>We are slowly making progress towards getting public urls for
			those who want to let others see their corpus publicly. We are
			realizing this is a top priority for grant committees, but for
			research team it is super complicated, requiring them to get approval
			from their language consultant to open their data. Essentially, we
			don't know anyone who actually needs the public url right now so we
			haven't been making it a priority.</p>


		<h2>Presented FieldDB at Javascript Montreal</h2>
		<p>
			@trisapeace and @cesine <a
				href="slides/shells/onstage.html#../offline_databases.html">presented
				the technical sides of the app at Javascript Montreal</a>. In the

		<h2>Intern dipps her toes into Android development</h2>
		<p>Since she finished the Learn Mi'gmaq prototype this week Elise
			also looking back into getting the app to run offline on Android and
			iPad using TouchDB. When we found out that Chrome worked on Android
			and iPad we planned to use the Chrome store to run the app on
			tablets. But, it turns out that the Chrome store isn't available yet
			on the mobile version of Chrome. We had some old code from June which
			started setting up TouchDB on the android. Elise explored the
			codebases, and another code base for keeping a Grocery list offline
			using TouchDB.</p>

		<h2>Chrome 23.0.1271.26 changes the IndexedDB spec</h2>

		<p>
			At one point this week we woke up to a dashboard that wouldn't load
			(it just said Untitled corpus). The culprit was a new version of
			Chrome (we are using the beta version, which is about 1 month before
			users). It turns out that the IndexedDBs created with previous
			versions of Chrome need to be updated. We have two options, try to
			fix PouchDB's update function and contribute it upstream to the
			PouchDB guys, or write a script to log users out, move their
			databases and the log them back in so that they have fresh new
			pouches filled with their data. We created an issue for this here...

		<h1>September 29 2012 - Week 22 &amp; 23 - Upgraded our version
			of Node.js from 0.6.19 to 0.8.10 Multiple corpora and Refactored
			Authentication web service</h1>

		<h2 id="onthebleedingedge">A new authentication server</h2>
		<p>This week we worked on refactoring (thats techie talk for
			re-writing and re-designing) the authentication webservice so we
			could use up-to-date libraries. We were stuck on an older version of
			node because the authentication library we were using was using an
			older version of express etc etc. Now we switched authentication
			libraries, and switched database back-ends so now users are stored in
			a couchdb also. We also added a mailer library to send out emails to
			users if they forget their password and to welcome when they first
			sign up so that they have their username written down somewhere.</p>
		<p>
			Its been 5 weeks since we deployed an updated version of the app,
			mostly because of big changes that needed to be done (like the
			authentication server) before we could let users really use the app,
			not just as beta testers. This week <a
				href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jclfbgmjfgkmjdiknoccaobgbkifmlcp">we
				deployed a new chrome extension which is on the bleeding edge of
				development</a>, once its stable enough the developers are using it,
			version of the app which we are calling "unstable." So if you like to
			be on the edge, or just see what new features are coming up, you can
			install that version at the same times as the normal (stable)
			version. Ideally we would like a couple of people using the unstable
			version for about a month or so before it will go into the stable
			version. It depends on the speed at which we are developing.
		</p>

		<h2 id=>Multiple Corpora and a new flow</h2>
		<p>Having a clean auth service helped us roll out the new corpora
			feature faster. We also changed the way the dashboard loads. Before
			it would start at the index, see if it knew who you were, and then
			see if it knew which dashboard you last used, and then redirect you
			to the dashboard page if it knew which corpus, session and datalist
			to load. That was fine for development and for testing the dashboard
			but we really needed a way that you could change between corpora
			safely. Because the Pouch database (which is unique per corpus) must
			be set on all objects are saved we had invented a rather complicated
			work around to be sure that objects where saved into the right pouch
			the first time. Now we have added an intermediary page (a users
			dashboard) which will load your user info and let you choose a corpus
			if it is unable to figure out what to load for you. This greatly
			simplifies the loading of a corpus and in fact, if a user is on the
			corpus.html page we can now guarentee that the pouch they want to
			work in is known so we might be able to refactor out the workaround
			that we put in place back in June. In theory, this should make the
			app much more stable as we are finally getting closer to how it was
			designed to be, not how it had to be so we could debug, it has
			certainly reduced the number of ifs.... We won't know for sure if the
			new flow is stable until we get a few more testers using it.</p>

		<p>
			We are also excited to announce that the Default/All Data datalist is
			gone. We have had it in the app for a longtime, before we had search,
			largely because we wanted to be able to show you a list of your
			datum, and we didn't have search to be able to retrieve it. We've had
			offline search in the pouch for a long time now, so its about time
			that we use search to show you all your data. This greatly simplifies
			the app. Before if you saved a datum, we had to see if the All data
			list was active, and insert the new datum at the top so you could see
			it visually as you entered data. In addition, if the All data list
			wasn't visible we had to go into the corpus and insert the datum into
			it, and then be sure that the All data list that was in the corpus,
			got saved into the pouch before you wanted to load it. Essentially an
			nightmare of <a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">de-normalizaiton</a>
			. So it is with great pleasure that we tell you that you can find all
			your data, by clicking on the search icon. Of course, if you have a
			lot of data it will take some time to load the data list. We will
			modify the Infinite Paginated Updating Collection view to be smarter
			about how much data it loads. That will have to wait...

		<h1>September 15 2012 - Week 20 &amp; 21 - Language-learning aid
			app starts &amp; and an unrelated admin password leak fixed</h1>


		<h2 id="dbadmincredentialsleaked">CouchDB Admin Credentials
			leaked</h2>
		<p>At 10:57am Eastern Standard Time yesterday morning (Friday
			September 14th 2012-09-14T12:12:57-07:00) a former intern
			inadvertently leaked admin password to the CouchDB account used to
			create corpora for the Beta testers.</p>

		<p>
			What this means is that unauthorized persons could discover the
			password <a
				href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/pull/465">via
				a commit on our repository</a> and access/delete/administrate the data
			in beta tester's corpus databases hosted at <a
				href="https://ilanguage.iriscouch.com/_utils">https://ilanguage.iriscouch.com/_utils</a>
			This leak did not create any vulnerabilities in your private user
			data (i.e. email, first name last name etc) as that data is stored in
			a different database.
		</p>

		<p>At 19:26pm Eastern Standard Time this evening (Saturday
			September 15th) we rolled out a fix to the vulnerability on the
			authentication server, and the Corpus database server. We also turned
			off the registration of all new users in the Chrome store app and
			started an investigation into the impact of the leak.</p>

		<p>
			Database and log analysis have shown that the no corpus databases
			were accessed or modified during this 17 hour time period. All
			affected users have been or will be contacted once we are certain of
			the findings. To make it easier to contact users once we leave beta
			we will be asking users to provide an email address when they
			register, as is standard with most websites.The root cause of the
			vulnerability was an trusting an inexperienced developer with <a
				href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=admin+credentials+leaked&oq=admin+credentials+leaked">
				sensitive credentials</a>, and a subsequent "check-in" of those
			sensitive credentials into our GitHub repository, a problem which is
			common among inexperienced developers.
		</p>

		<p>Prior to the leak we had initiated a full audit of the codebase
			to ensure that no instances of this vulnerability were present. This
			audit is was complete on Wednesday, Aug 29, 2012 at 2:05 PM, however
			the developer in question did not read the emailed instructions and
			inadvertantly commited the sensitive files and pushed them to their
			GitHub account, making the files public. I am going to personally
			ensure that we our strategy going forward to prevent this type of
			vulnerability is enforced. I sincerely apologize for allowing this to
			happen.</p>
		<p>
			While no damage was done, we believe it is important to keep you
			informed about the security of your linguistic data. We will continue
			to encourage inexperienced developers to contribute to the project,
			as that is one of the main reasons we made it: to empower linguists
			to build and modify their tools, however we will no longer trust
			inexperienced developers with sensitive deployment config files.
			Security is our priority and I will be arranging <a
				href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/issues/582">external
				security audits</a> to further test our security measures and give you
			peace of mind.

			The goal is to make it easy for teachers and field linguists to work
			together to make lessons from their corpora.</p>

			August 3 2012 - Week 15 - Demo at <a href="http://mayanfamli.org/">CAML</a>
		</h1>


		<h2>Spanish Screencasts</h2>
		<p>This week we created new Spanish screencasts to prepare for a
			workshop on how to use FieldDB to enter/import data at CAML. We
			published them to YouTube after we came back because we didn't have
			good enough internet at our hotel. Here they are:</p>

			frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<h2>Demo and Feedback</h2>
		<p>
			The CAML room didn't have tables or a lot of space to walk around and
			help participants so instead of giving a workshop and showing how to
			import data we just demoed the project and answered some of the
			audience's questions. Some of the most important questions we got
			were about import and export file types and why we were making a new
			software for field linguists. Gretchen incorporated the audiences
			questions into a new <a target="_blank"
				href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/pub?id=1KQaq4jbGM9roakDNPuj_jxWPL5v0NXJNBWaLJpqDzHc&start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000">slide
				show</a> and we put up a spiffy <a href="http://fieldlinguist.com">website</a>.
			The demo was <a target="_blank"

		<h2>Spanish screencasts for regular expressions</h2>
		<p>
			We also got together with other techie linguists for a "hacking"
			session on Thursday night at the top of Patzun Plaza to share tools
			and tips in extracting particular examples from fieldwork data using
			Unix commandline tools like the recipes in <a target="_blank"
				href="http://people.sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/compling04/UnixforPoets.pdf">Unix

		<h2>The big merge</h2>
		<p>This week we merged in the localization branch and the bug
			fix/new features branch. It was a big merge and took us about a day
			to do. We worked on fixing some of the resulting bugs where events
			were getting lost due to a mixture of layers of help popovers and
			jquery calls to modify non-existant dom elements. We got most of the
			bugs fixed so that we could demo at least the ability to gloss and
			find morphemes, visualize morphemes, add comments on all objects in
			the system, import data from csv, add new datum fields to the corpus
			either by importing or by hand, searching data etc.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="well">
		<h1>July 27 2012 - Week 14 - Localization, Major refactor and bug
			fixes</h1>

		<h2>More help texts, toasts and localization</h2>

		<p>This week we implemented some of the beta tester requests
			including importing .sf Toolbox files, adding tooltips on all the
			buttons and icons to tell the user what they are for, and minimizing
			some of the dashboard widgets (datalists, activity feed, unicode).</p>

		<p>We added a user interface to add other users to your corpus,
			either as administrators, or as contributers who can edit info/data,
			or collaborators who can only see data. We also added a user
			interface for you to change your corpus from private to public or
			public to private.</p>

		<p>We worked on localizing the app so that we can translate it
			seamlessly into Spanish, in preparation for our launch at the Corpus
			Approaches to Mayan Linguistics workshop in Guatemala.</p>

		<h2>Major refactor and bug fixes</h2>
		<p>We also fixed a bug in advanced search that wasn't showing all
			the corpus' extra fields. (It was cloning the copurs fields too
			early, now when it renders, it looks up the datum fields and session
			fields so it is always up-to-date).</p>


		<p>We refactored the way we were saving models in backbone to
			create a save method that makes sure the model is saved in the right
			pouch, and made sure that the model was interconnected where it
			needed to be in the app (ie, if it is a new session, save it into the
			corpus, and put it as the most recent session for the user so we can
			re-load their dashboard if they leave etc).</p>

		<p>We refactored the confidentiality encryption for datum in the
			new datum architecture (where each field is an object, not just a
			value) by adding a custom save function in the datum fields (which
			gets called each time backbone tries to set something on the
			DatumField object).</p>


		<p>This week we also refactored the data list module to use a
			paginated updating collections view, cleaned the app router and app
			view to reduce the number of views to just 1 per edit &amp; read
			version of the models for DataList, Search, and Corpus, reduced the
			number of duplicate events fireing by destroying views when we
			rendered over divs, refactored search, created a new widget for
			search just above the data list, made any datum matching the current
			search query automatically pop up in the temporary search list for
			Alan, and turned the activity feed into paginated updating collection
			too.</p>

		<h1>July 20 2012 - Week 13 - Semi-automatic glossing, morpheme
			segmentation, a "cute" visualization of morphemes, drag and drop
			audio</h1>

		<iframe width="420" height="315"
			src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vEPfnUnnbj0" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen></iframe>


		<h2>Semi-automatic glossing and morhpheme segmentation</h2>
		<p>This week we built a morpheme segmenter using the user's
			morpheme segmentation line to find morphemes. It takes in the
			previous morpheme lines, creates linear precedence rules for the
			morphemes and then stores these as rules. When it is fed a new word
			(or sequence of words), it looks up in these precedence rules to find
			potential matching rules. Using the matching rules it tries to build
			a mini finite state machine to segment the word into morphemes. On
			our sample of 76 Quechua utterances it usually misses 1-2 morpheme
			boundaries per word. It is designed to keep "learning" each time the
			user syncs up to the server the get the latest version of their
			morpheme finder's precedence rules.</p>

		<p>We also built an auto-glosser which takes in a word (or a line
			of words) and looks up the potential glosses for each morpheme in the
			lexicon (which, like the precedence rules is built from previous
			existing datum). At the moment it takes the most popular gloss for
			the morphemes. It also assumes you are using Leipzig conventions to
			gloss your data. Like the morpheme finder, it gets smarter the more
			data you gloss.</p>

		<p>Both the morpheme finder and glosser are trained on your
			corpus, but in reality any corpus can use any precedence rules or
			lexicon. This is done so that if you have a large corpus of cleaned
			data, you can share your precedence rules or lexicon with anyone
			working on the same dialect so that they don't have to build up a
			large corpus to take advantage of semi-automatic morpheme/gloss
			prediction.</p>

		<h2>Report "bots" and data visualization</h2>

		<p>
			Using the precedence rules extracted from the corpus we were able to
			do a really quick visualization using a <a href="http://d3js.org/">Force
				Directed graph in D3</a>. D3 is a pretty awesome javascript
			visualization library that makes SVG (ie, images that you can edit as
			vectors, and print at any size!). We looked around for visualizations
			and settled on a really quick simple one which lets you see the
			morphemes as nodes in a connected graph, where each edge (connection)
			in the graph is a linear ordering. If you hover over a node you can
			see what morpheme it is, and by the color you can see which morphemes
			need to be cleaned (ie ones that are abnormally long are in orange).
			Later on we will make some more visualizations (hopefully something
			with more linguistic info), and make it so you can click on the nodes
			and see the datum that the node came from (useful if you want to use
			the visualization to help you clean your data).
		</p>

		<h2>HTML5 audio</h2>
		<p>After some work the HTML5 audio player is finally working
			properly, you can drag and drop an audio file from your computer to
			the audio player in the datum you are working on. It will save the
			audio file in your FieldDB's local file storage. We still haven't set
			up the audio file server so the audio files are not being synced when
			you hit sync, but they are safely stored in your local FieldDB
			without a problem.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="well">
		<h1>July 13 2012 - Week 12 - Import, export, comments, activity
			feed all come together</h1>

		<p>This week we demoed the working features of FieldDB (and some
			of its bugs too) on Thursday. We finally got all the saving logic
			running though the app and were able to implement some of the fun
			features like drag and drop import, collapsing datum fields (so that
			rare fields don't clutter your interface). We also added a
			transparent theme for those of us who like to immerse ourselves in
			landscapes rather than computer screens.</p>
		<p>We also made a few screencasts for the beta testers to watch
			before trying to use the app. We invite all beta testers to send us
			sample data so we can make the app work for them. It took about 1
			hour to do the regular expressions in the CSV import, but after that
			it works for all CSV data. We hope it will be that easy with your
			data formats.</p>

		<h1>July 6 2012 - Week 11 - Building couches on the fly, and
			multiple pouches</h1>

		<p>This week we added couch generation to the authentication
			server. Now when you register a new user, their couch database, roles
			and permissions. We also set up a cookie system such that the user's
			browser talks directly to their couch server, once the authentication
			server has set it up.</p>

		<p>This week we also struggled with fixing a design flaw: we are
			switching from 1 pouch to 1 pouch per corpus. This is affecting the
			way the app is loading. We need to know which pouch to save to,
			before we download the corpus (a chicken and the egg sort of
			problem.)</p>
		<p>We set up the data entry area to accept 1 or more datum at a
			time, which the users can set in their preferences.</p>
		<p>We added help conventions pop overs to the data fields so that
			if teams want to sent some conventions, or leave hints for each other
			they can.</p>
		<p>We also worked on adding checkboxes to the datalists so that
			users can select certain datum for export etc.</p>

		<h1>June 29 2012 - Week 10 - Refactoring and Authentication</h1>
		<p>This week we redid our conventions for views and handlebars.
			After this we cleaned up the handlebars divs, and got all fullscreen
			buttons working, as well as made all widgets togglable between edit
			and readonly.</p>

		<p>We also set up authentication so users could login with either
			a username and password, or they could use another existing login on
			another service (ie, gmail, yahoo, facebook, twitter) if they didn't
			want to remember yet another login and password.</p>

		<p>We worked on pretifying the corpus details page by making the
			different settings (like data fields, data status, permissions)
			collapsable.</p>

		<h1>June 22 2012 - Week 9 - Search and security between black
			boxes is started</h1>

		<h2>Datum fields and datum states are adaptable to your corpus</h2>
		<p>This we we moved from hard coded datum fields and states that
			we were using while scaffolding out backone, to truely being able to
			decide on datum fields and datum states by the corpus administrator</p>

		<h2>LaTeX looking Data lists</h2>
		<p>Datalists are showing data in a LaTeX way (ie, the glosses and
			words are all properly aligned so you can read the examples in a
			quick glance)</p>

		<h2>Search: intersection or union</h2>
		<p>Intersection search and Union search are working. Users can
			search using any of the datum fields.</p>

		<h2>Moving to EC2: Amazon Elastic Cloud</h2>

		<p>Heroku seems to want us to pay 20$ a month to use https (a
			secure connection). So we switched to EC2 which we expected to do
			anyway since heroku is more expensive (it is a platform as a service,
			probably built off of EC2 or a similar cloud)</p>


		<h2>Securing Authentication and Database</h2>
		<p>This week we worked on getting EveryAuth to work. EveryAuth is
			a node module built on top of OAuth which allows users to log in
			using their other accounts, so that we have no password info for
			them, and they don't have another password to remember. We also
			worked on locking down the database and getting new users into the
			database via the authentication hook, not just via backbone.</p>

		<p>In this video Hisako explains what happens when the user clicks
			"Sync," and how we insure that data are not modified without proper
			permissions. Similar to offline games, we "replay" the edits on the
			server to be sure that no one with unauthorized access can modify the
			central database. What this means is that if the users have been able
			to download the data while they were offline, they can edit it, but
			they wont be able to sync (ie share their edits) unless they have the
			proper permissions.</p>

		<img src="images/team_at_work.jpg" width="800" />
		<p>This week continued much from last week. We also prettified the
			app, using Bootstrap by Twitter, a framework for cute buttons, icons
			and fonts. There is still the import and search user stories to
			complete and modules to connect. We connected the modules to PouchDB,
			the portable offline version of CouchDB. We are still working on
			getting the Offline corpus to work on Android using TouchDB. As far
			as we know, we are the 3rd large project to use TouchDB, it's
			implementation of CouchDB might not even be complete so we might have
			to help them out so that we can use it. The PouchDB folks have also
			found out we were watching them and have also been implementing
			things around the clock. The database that PouchDB is using
			(IndexedDB) is an HTML5 specification that wasn't even implemented
			until 6 months ago in December. We are using a special advance
			developers version of Chrome that will be availible only in August,
			when we launch. Talk about being on the bleeding-edge of development!</p>

		<p>
			In addition, this week we created a new folder entitled <a
				href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/tree/master/docs">docs</a>
			which contains files that are designed to help those interested who
			want to use this project for their data collection and need a
			methodology section for their grant (or want to add a programming
			budget to their grant app to finish the "dream modules").

		</p>
		<p>
			If you're a fieldlinguist and you are curious about our app, these
			docs are for you. You can get either the .pdf or the .tex files. In
			these files, you will find information about our goals and
			objectives, evaluation metrics, and estimations of time and cost. <a

		<h2>Making Data Fields and Session Fields that truely adapt to
			your data</h2>
		<p>We also stated the refactor (the re-doing) of the Datums and
			Sessions. Here is Hisako explaining how the Datums and Sessions will
			"learn" and adapt to the team that is building their corpus.</p>

		<h1>June 8 2012 - Week 7 - Connecting the modules</h1>
		<p>This week implemented more views and clarify the connections
			between different modules. We started with what Emmy coined
			"boardcasts" showing the control flow for 3 different "User Stories."
			We have begun refactoring the site to reflect the ER diagram.
			Additionally, we connected our modules to IrisCouch, a hosting
			service for databases (a couch in cloud, it costs $1 per gigabite per
			month). In addition, we implemented pagination for the datalist view.</p>

		<h2>Paginator and the DataListView Sequence Diagram</h2>

		<p>Here is a boardcast about the sequence of events happening in
			the paginator with explaination in terms of the DataList for our
			application. DataLists are like favorites where users can put
			together a list of datum for a special purpose like creating a
			handout for a conference, or a list of data to prepare for a session
			with a consultant etc. DataLists can be pretty big, so we need to
			"paginate" them. we have decided to paginate them by sorting the most
			recent first.</p>

		<h2>Getting from Handlebars to the App</h2>

		<p>In implementing the connection between views and modules we
			want to start fleshing out the views with handlebars and integrating
			them into the app. This video will start you out with your handlebars
			template and takes you through backbone to finally render the view.

		<h1>June 1 2012 - Week 6 - Testing the modules</h1>
		<p>
			This week we set up the corpus database using CouchDB hosted on
			IrisCouch and wrote more testing code which specifies what functions
			the module must complete. Tests serve as <a href="">documentation</a>
			for what each class (you can think of classes as module) does. Tests
			also serve as sample client code for future developers when they want
			to use the modules, they can look at the module's tests to how to use
			the module's functionality.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also set up a testing environment for embedding widgets such as
			{DataList Widget, Data Search Widget, Activity Feed Widget} <a
				href="http://ilanguage.ca/about/about-ilanguage-lab/fieldlinguistics-web-widgets/">into
				a WordPress post</a>. Note, the testing post is private, use password
			"fieldlinguistics" to see it. The web widgets will allow linguists to
			let others interact with their data on their blogs.
		</p>
		<p>We have an initial implementation of ActivityFeeds, Datum
			Menus, the Lexicon indexer and the Confidentiality encryption using
			the AES encryption standard approved by the US Federal Government.</p>
		<p>We wrapped up the week with a cleaned up diagram for how the
			modules are related, in the form of an Entity Relationship Diagram.</p>

			for what each class (you can think of classes as module) does.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also published the <a

		<h1>May 11 2012 - Week 4 - Three Black Boxes</h1>
		<h2>Continuous Build Server is up: Meet our butler, Jenkins</h2>
		<p>Jenkins is set up and building the project every time someone
			commits to GitHub. When the build fails, Jenkins emails the group
			(this encourages us to do code review and make sure at least two
			pairs of eyes see the code that get checks in.) Jenkins is public so
			anyone outside the project can also see if the builds are succeeding.
		</p>
		<p>If the builds succeeds Jenkins is also continuously deploying
			to the actual website.</p>

		<h1>May 4 2012 - Week 3 - Gimp User Interface Designs</h1>


		<p>The main dashboard can be very cluttered: have a team feed,
			multiple data entries, and the drop down quick search (a la
			spotlight), This one is the Llama skin:</p>
		<img src="/images/user_interface_design_gimp.png" alt="llama skin" />
		<p>The data entry page could be much less cluttered, here is an
