		<h1>September 10 2012 - Week 20 - Language-learning aid app starts</h1>

		<h2></h2>
		<p>This Thursday we started working on an outline for a new module 
		(with our new intern, Elise). This module will be an aid for language-
		learners, giving audio/visual and textual language lessons. The goal
		is to make it easy for teachers and field linguists to work together
		to make lessons from their corpora.</p>

		<h2>Paper prototype photos</h2>
			
		<img src="/images/devblog/LL1Welcome_UnitChoice.jpg" height="50%"

		<p>The top is the welcome screen for learners, and the bottom is the 
		screen to choose which thematic unit the learner wants to work on. 
		The unit choice screen also gives a quick update on how much of the 
		material the student has finished, by showing progress bars.</p>
		
		<img src="/images/devblog/LL2Lesson.jpg" height="50%"
			width="50%" />
		<p>The top is the lesson choice screen, which also has progress bars. 
		Each lesson consists of three components: Dialogue, Vocabulary, and 
		Exercise.</p>

		<img src="/images/devblog/LL2LessonIntro.jpg" height="50%"

		<p>  When the student chooses a lesson, an intro screen will show up to 
		summarize the coming material.</p>

		<img src="/images/devblog/LL3Dialogue.jpg" height="50%"
			width="50%" />
		<p>Dialogue: This has a video and audio of a conversation between 
		two speakers. The student can show textual transcription & translation, 
		or choose to hide the text to better immerse themselves in spoken language. 
		The transcription is also time-synched with the audio.</p>

		<img src="/images/devblog/LL5VocabChoice.jpg" height="50%"

		<p>Vocab: In this menu, the student chooses which vocab item that they want to learn.</p>

		<img src="/images/devblog/LL6Vocab.jpg" height="50%"
			width="50%" />
		<p>Vocab: Here, there is a picture/video and audio demonstrating the word. 
		It comes with optional transcription and translation. Students practice the 
		pronunciation by recording themselves and listening to their recording compared 
		to the given one.</p>
		
		<img src="/images/devblog/LL4Exercise.jpg" height="50%"

		<h1>August 31 2012 - Weeks 18 &amp; 19 - Two activity feeds and
			preparing for Field methods beta testing</h1>

		<p>
			This week we started setting up iField on a McGill server, and <a
				target="_blank"
				href="https://github.com/iLanguage/iField/wiki/How-to-install-on-your-own-server">adding
				more documentation for others who want to set up iField or set up a
				developers environment for iField.</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			Gretchen also made us a <a target="_blank"
				href="http://www.facebook.com/iFieldApp">Facebook fan page</a> where
			we can put some non-technical updates when we release new versions of
			the app (we will probably keep the technical updates here so that
			normal users don't get confused with this techno-babble), she also
			made a sort of user group on facebook called<a target="_blank"
				href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/486887294657548/"> iField
				keeners</a> to let "iField keeners" share slides if someone in their
			department asks them to give a presentation. Yuliya's department at
			Stony Brook was curious too so she will probably be giving a
			presentation in October. We also showed the app to Michael Diercks at
			Pomona (California) who will probably join our advisory board and
			help us test the app for use in a field methods class. We went
			through the app looking for bugs and unfinished features that we need
			to have ready and put them into the <a target="_blank"
				href="https://github.com/iLanguage/iField/issues?milestone=21&state=open">Field
				Methods Beta Testing Milestone</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			With the new Facebook pages we also need a real logo! If you know
			anyone with some design skills please send them to <a target="_blank"
				href="http://www.facebook.com/iFieldApp">our fan page where we
				are brainstorming the logo</a>, we'd like to have one by the end of
			September.
		</p>

		<p>We also refactored the comments to move the code to the models
			from the views to reduce code duplication</p>

		<p>We made finished making the two activity feeds functional,
			sycnable to their servers and saveable. While we were at it we and
			added cute icons for all the objects in the system (sessions,
			datalists, corpus, permissions). We also made the activity feed cuter
			using icons for actions and direct objects, and most importantly, we
			now have nicer timestamps (i.e. 2 seconds ago).</p>

		<h1>August 17 2012 - Week 17 - More bug fixes, more cute features
			and started the new activity feeds</h1>

		This week we released a ton of new bug fixes and features that had
		been in the works over the past two weeks.

		<ul>
			<li>Finished verified the localization of all modules. The
				details are in the comments on <a target="_blank"
				href="https://github.com/iLanguage/iField/pull/464">Pull Request
					#464</a>
			</li>
			<li>Made the page scroll to the top when the user starts a new
				datum or wants to edit a datum</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in the sync button being called twice</li>
			<li>Pre-parsed the activity strings so that the links were
				active, and cleaned up the app router so that the links actually
				worked</li>
			<li>Started the work to divide activity feeds into pouches so
				that each feed would go in its own database</li>
			<li>Started the user interface for the two activity feeds, one
				for user, one for team</li>
			<li>Got the corpus mask to save as "corpus" in the database so
				that the Node router doesn't need to know the id of the corpus to
				show its public view, only the pouch info is needed.</li>
			<li>Added a whole bunch of help info to the user menu, as well
				as the version of iField so they can see which version they are
				using</li>
			<li>Made infrequent unicode white and frequent yellow</li>
			<li>Added strike out on deleted datum</li>
			<li>Added color coding using datum state (checked, to be
				checked, deleted, and whatever the user chooses) to the data list</li>
			<li>Tried to pin down the mysterious datum state that was
				getting inserted, added a workaround instead...</li>
			<li>Added more details on how to set up an iField server for
				department server admins</li>
			<li>Re-did the icons and buttons on datum and data list into a
				button group</li>
			<li>Added a remove button to the datalist to remove datum from
				the data list, maybe later we will add a dropdown so they can also
				delete datum (or change their state) from the datalist</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="well">
		<h1>August 10 2012 - Week 16 - Bug fixes and refactor of the
			session views.</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>This week we refactored the session views to be sure that
				events weren't getting lost, or firing from ghost views.</li>
			<li>Added timestamps to the Datum user interface so the users
				can see their datum are saved every 10 seconds</li>
			<li>Added a save button to the Datum so that it was consistent
				through out the app</li>
			<li>Made the nav bar fit better on a small screen by putting
				just the search icon and a dropdown to find advanced search</li>
			<li>Added more tooltips around the app to tell users what things
				were for</li>
			<li>Verified the localization of a few of the modules</li>

			August 3 2012 - Week 15 - Demo at <a href="http://mayanfamli.org/">CAML</a>
		</h1>


		<h2>Spanish Screencasts</h2>
		<p>This week we created new Spanish screencasts to prepare for a
			workshop on how to use iField to enter/import data at CAML. We
			published them to YouTube after we came back because we didn't have
			good enough internet at our hotel. Here they are:</p>

		<iframe width="560" height="315"
			src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL7D2CC06C80AF754C&amp;hl=en_US"
			frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<h2>Demo and Feedback</h2>
		<p>
			The CAML room didn't have tables or a lot of space to walk around and
			help participants so instead of giving a workshop and showing how to
			import data we just demoed the project and answered some of the
			audience's questions. Some of the most important questions we got
			were about import and export file types and why we were making a new
			software for field linguists. Gretchen incorporated the audiences
			questions into a new <a target="_blank"
				href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/pub?id=1KQaq4jbGM9roakDNPuj_jxWPL5v0NXJNBWaLJpqDzHc&start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000">slide
				show</a> and we put up a spiffy <a href="http://fieldlinguist.com">website</a>.
			The demo was <a target="_blank"
				href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MuniPatzun?blend=1&ob=0"> live
				streamed</a> by the <a target="_blank"
				href="http://patzun.gob.gt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=391:idiomas&catid=99:cultura&Itemid=439">Patzun
				municipality</a>.
			<h2>Spanish screencasts for regular expressions</h2>
		<p>
			We also got together with other techie linguists for a "hacking"
			session on Thursday night at the top of Patzun Plaza to share tools
			and tips in extracting particular examples from fieldwork data using
			Unix commandline tools like the recipes in <a target="_blank"
				href="http://people.sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/compling04/UnixforPoets.pdf">Unix
				for Poets</a>. Below are some screen casts Emmy made in Spanish for some
			of the Chuj speakers for how they can use regular expressions to
			extract info from their transcribed child language acquisition data.

		<h2>The big merge</h2>
		<p>This week we merged in the localization branch and the bug
			fix/new features branch. It was a big merge and took us about a day
			to do. We worked on fixing some of the resulting bugs where events
			were getting lost due to a mixture of layers of help popovers and
			jquery calls to modify non-existant dom elements. We got most of the
			bugs fixed so that we could demo at least the ability to gloss and
			find morphemes, visualize morphemes, add comments on all objects in
			the system, import data from csv, add new datum fields to the corpus
			either by importing or by hand, searching data etc.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="well">
		<h1>July 27 2012 - Week 14 - Localization, Major refactor and bug
			fixes</h1>

		<h2>More help texts, toasts and localization</h2>

		<p>This week we implemented some of the beta tester requests
			including importing .sf Toolbox files, adding tooltips on all the
			buttons and icons to tell the user what they are for, and minimizing
			some of the dashboard widgets (datalists, activity feed, unicode).</p>

		<p>We added a user interface to add other users to your corpus,
			either as administrators, or as contributers who can edit info/data,
			or collaborators who can only see data. We also added a user
			interface for you to change your corpus from private to public or
			public to private.</p>

		<p>We worked on localizing the app so that we can translate it
			seamlessly into Spanish, in preparation for our launch at the Corpus
			Approaches to Mayan Linguistics workshop in Guatemala.</p>

		<h2>Major refactor and bug fixes</h2>
		<p>We also fixed a bug in advanced search that wasn't showing all
			the corpus' extra fields. (It was cloning the copurs fields too
			early, now when it renders, it looks up the datum fields and session
			fields so it is always up-to-date).</p>


		<p>We refactored the way we were saving models in backbone to
			create a save method that makes sure the model is saved in the right
			pouch, and made sure that the model was interconnected where it
			needed to be in the app (ie, if it is a new session, save it into the
			corpus, and put it as the most recent session for the user so we can
			re-load their dashboard if they leave etc).</p>

		<p>We refactored the confidentiality encryption for datum in the
			new datum architecture (where each field is an object, not just a
			value) by adding a custom save function in the datum fields (which
			gets called each time backbone tries to set something on the
			DatumField object).</p>


		<p>This week we also refactored the data list module to use a
			paginated updating collections view, cleaned the app router and app
			view to reduce the number of views to just 1 per edit &amp; read
			version of the models for DataList, Search, and Corpus, reduced the
			number of duplicate events fireing by destroying views when we
			rendered over divs, refactored search, created a new widget for
			search just above the data list, made any datum matching the current
			search query automatically pop up in the temporary search list for
			Alan, and turned the activity feed into paginated updating collection
			too.</p>

		<h1>July 20 2012 - Week 13 - Semi-automatic glossing, morpheme
			segmentation, a "cute" visualization of morphemes, drag and drop
			audio</h1>

		<iframe width="420" height="315"
			src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vEPfnUnnbj0" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen></iframe>


		<h2>Semi-automatic glossing and morhpheme segmentation</h2>
		<p>This week we built a morpheme segmenter using the user's
			morpheme segmentation line to find morphemes. It takes in the
			previous morpheme lines, creates linear precedence rules for the
			morphemes and then stores these as rules. When it is fed a new word
			(or sequence of words), it looks up in these precedence rules to find
			potential matching rules. Using the matching rules it tries to build
			a mini finite state machine to segment the word into morphemes. On
			our sample of 76 Quechua utterances it usually misses 1-2 morpheme
			boundaries per word. It is designed to keep "learning" each time the
			user syncs up to the server the get the latest version of their
			morpheme finder's precedence rules.</p>

		<p>We also built an auto-glosser which takes in a word (or a line
			of words) and looks up the potential glosses for each morpheme in the
			lexicon (which, like the precedence rules is built from previous
			existing datum). At the moment it takes the most popular gloss for
			the morphemes. It also assumes you are using Leipzig conventions to
			gloss your data. Like the morpheme finder, it gets smarter the more
			data you gloss.</p>

		<p>Both the morpheme finder and glosser are trained on your
			corpus, but in reality any corpus can use any precedence rules or
			lexicon. This is done so that if you have a large corpus of cleaned
			data, you can share your precedence rules or lexicon with anyone
			working on the same dialect so that they don't have to build up a
			large corpus to take advantage of semi-automatic morpheme/gloss
			prediction.</p>

		<h2>Report "bots" and data visualization</h2>

		<p>
			Using the precedence rules extracted from the corpus we were able to
			do a really quick visualization using a <a href="http://d3js.org/">Force
				Directed graph in D3</a>. D3 is a pretty awesome javascript
			visualization library that makes SVG (ie, images that you can edit as
			vectors, and print at any size!). We looked around for visualizations
			and settled on a really quick simple one which lets you see the
			morphemes as nodes in a connected graph, where each edge (connection)
			in the graph is a linear ordering. If you hover over a node you can
			see what morpheme it is, and by the color you can see which morphemes
			need to be cleaned (ie ones that are abnormally long are in orange).
			Later on we will make some more visualizations (hopefully something
			with more linguistic info), and make it so you can click on the nodes
			and see the datum that the node came from (useful if you want to use
			the visualization to help you clean your data).
		</p>

		<h2>HTML5 audio</h2>
		<p>After some work the HTML5 audio player is finally working
			properly, you can drag and drop an audio file from your computer to
			the audio player in the datum you are working on. It will save the
			audio file in your iField's local file storage. We still haven't set
			up the audio file server so the audio files are not being synced when
			you hit sync, but they are safely stored in your local iField without
			a problem.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="well">
		<h1>July 13 2012 - Week 12 - Import, export, comments, activity
			feed all come together</h1>

		<p>This week we demoed the working features of iField (and some of
			its bugs too) on Thursday. We finally got all the saving logic
			running though the app and were able to implement some of the fun
			features like drag and drop import, collapsing datum fields (so that
			rare fields don't clutter your interface). We also added a
			transparent theme for those of us who like to immerse ourselves in
			landscapes rather than computer screens.</p>
		<p>We also made a few screencasts for the beta testers to watch
			before trying to use the app. We invite all beta testers to send us
			sample data so we can make the app work for them. It took about 1
			hour to do the regular expressions in the CSV import, but after that
			it works for all CSV data. We hope it will be that easy with your
			data formats.</p>

		<h1>July 6 2012 - Week 11 - Building couches on the fly, and
			multiple pouches</h1>

		<p>This week we added couch generation to the authentication
			server. Now when you register a new user, their couch database, roles
			and permissions. We also set up a cookie system such that the user's
			browser talks directly to their couch server, once the authentication
			server has set it up.</p>

		<p>This week we also struggled with fixing a design flaw: we are
			switching from 1 pouch to 1 pouch per corpus. This is affecting the
			way the app is loading. We need to know which pouch to save to,
			before we download the corpus (a chicken and the egg sort of
			problem.)</p>
		<p>We set up the data entry area to accept 1 or more datum at a
			time, which the users can set in their preferences.</p>
		<p>We added help conventions pop overs to the data fields so that
			if teams want to sent some conventions, or leave hints for each other
			they can.</p>
		<p>We also worked on adding checkboxes to the datalists so that
			users can select certain datum for export etc.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="well">
		<h1>June 29 2012 - Week 10 - Refactoring and Authentication</h1>
		<p>This week we redid our conventions for views and handlebars.
			After this we cleaned up the handlebars divs, and got all fullscreen
			buttons working, as well as made all widgets togglable between edit
			and readonly.</p>

		<p>We also set up authentication so users could login with either
			a username and password, or they could use another existing login on
			another service (ie, gmail, yahoo, facebook, twitter) if they didn't
			want to remember yet another login and password.</p>

		<p>We worked on pretifying the corpus details page by making the
			different settings (like data fields, data status, permissions)
			collapsable.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="well">
		<h1>June 22 2012 - Week 9 - Search and security between black
			boxes is started</h1>

		<h2>Datum fields and datum states are adaptable to your corpus</h2>
		<p>This we we moved from hard coded datum fields and states that
			we were using while scaffolding out backone, to truely being able to
			decide on datum fields and datum states by the corpus administrator</p>

		<h2>LaTeX looking Data lists</h2>
		<p>Datalists are showing data in a LaTeX way (ie, the glosses and
			words are all properly aligned so you can read the examples in a
			quick glance)</p>

		<h2>Search: intersection or union</h2>
		<p>Intersection search and Union search are working. Users can
			search using any of the datum fields.</p>

		<h2>Moving to EC2: Amazon Elastic Cloud</h2>

		<p>Heroku seems to want us to pay 20$ a month to use https (a
			secure connection). So we switched to EC2 which we expected to do
			anyway since heroku is more expensive (it is a platform as a service,
			probably built off of EC2 or a similar cloud)</p>


		<h2>Securing Authentication and Database</h2>
		<p>This week we worked on getting EveryAuth to work. EveryAuth is
			a node module built on top of OAuth which allows users to log in
			using their other accounts, so that we have no password info for
			them, and they don't have another password to remember. We also
			worked on locking down the database and getting new users into the
			database via the authentication hook, not just via backbone.</p>

		<p>In this video Hisako explains what happens when the user clicks
			"Sync," and how we insure that data are not modified without proper
			permissions. Similar to offline games, we "replay" the edits on the
			server to be sure that no one with unauthorized access can modify the
			central database. What this means is that if the users have been able
			to download the data while they were offline, they can edit it, but
			they wont be able to sync (ie share their edits) unless they have the
			proper permissions.</p>

		<h1>June 15 2012 - Week 8 - Prettifying and getting all the Views
			in place, and a new Name!</h1>

		<img src="images/devblog/team_at_work.jpg" width="800" />
		<p>This week continued much from last week. We also prettified the
			app, using Bootstrap by Twitter, a framework for cute buttons, icons
			and fonts. There is still the import and search user stories to
			complete and modules to connect. We connected the modules to PouchDB,
			the portable offline version of CouchDB. We are still working on
			getting the Offline corpus to work on Android using TouchDB. As far
			as we know, we are the 3rd large project to use TouchDB, it's
			implementation of CouchDB might not even be complete so we might have
			to help them out so that we can use it. The PouchDB folks have also
			found out we were watching them and have also been implementing
			things around the clock. The database that PouchDB is using
			(IndexedDB) is an HTML5 specification that wasn't even implemented
			until 6 months ago in December. We are using a special advance
			developers version of Chrome that will be availible only in August,
			when we launch. Talk about being on the bleeding-edge of development!</p>

		<p>
			In addition, this week we created a new folder entitled <a
				href="https://github.com/iLanguage/iField/tree/master/docs">docs</a>
			which contains files that are designed to help those interested who
			want to use this project for their data collection and need a
			methodology section for their grant (or want to add a programming
			budget to their grant app to finish the "dream modules").

		</p>
		<p>
			If you're a fieldlinguist and you are curious about our app, these
			docs are for you. You can get either the .pdf or the .tex files. In
			these files, you will find information about our goals and
			objectives, evaluation metrics, and estimations of time and cost. <a

		<h2>Making Data Fields and Session Fields that truely adapt to
			your data</h2>
		<p>We also stated the refactor (the re-doing) of the Datums and
			Sessions. Here is Hisako explaining how the Datums and Sessions will
			"learn" and adapt to the team that is building their corpus.</p>

		<h1>June 8 2012 - Week 7 - Connecting the modules</h1>
		<p>This week implemented more views and clarify the connections
			between different modules. We started with what Emmy coined
			"boardcasts" showing the control flow for 3 different "User Stories."
			We have begun refactoring the site to reflect the ER diagram.
			Additionally, we connected our modules to IrisCouch, a hosting
			service for databases (a couch in cloud, it costs $1 per gigabite per
			month). In addition, we implemented pagination for the datalist view.</p>

		<h2>Paginator and the DataListView Sequence Diagram</h2>

		<p>Here is a boardcast about the sequence of events happening in

			together a list of datum for a special purpose like creating a
			handout for a conference, or a list of data to prepare for a session
			with a consultant etc. DataLists can be pretty big, so we need to
			"paginate" them. we have decided to paginate them by sorting the most
			recent first.</p>

		<h2>Getting from Handlebars to the App</h2>

		<p>In implementing the connection between views and modules we
			want to start fleshing out the views with handlebars and integrating
			them into the app. This video will start you out with your handlebars
			template and takes you through backbone to finally render the view.

		<h1>June 1 2012 - Week 6 - Testing the modules</h1>
		<p>
			This week we set up the corpus database using CouchDB hosted on
			IrisCouch and wrote more testing code which specifies what functions
			the module must complete. Tests serve as <a href="">documentation</a>
			for what each class (you can think of classes as module) does. Tests
			also serve as sample client code for future developers when they want
			to use the modules, they can look at the module's tests to how to use
			the module's functionality.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also set up a testing environment for embedding widgets such as
			{DataList Widget, Data Search Widget, Activity Feed Widget} <a
				href="http://ilanguage.ca/about/about-ilanguage-lab/fieldlinguistics-web-widgets/">into
				a WordPress post</a>. Note, the testing post is private, use password
			"fieldlinguistics" to see it. The web widgets will allow linguists to
			let others interact with their data on their blogs.
		</p>
		<p>We have an initial implementation of ActivityFeeds, Datum
			Menus, the Lexicon indexer and the Confidentiality encryption using
			the AES encryption standard approved by the US Federal Government.</p>
		<p>We wrapped up the week with a cleaned up diagram for how the
			modules are related, in the form of an Entity Relationship Diagram.</p>
