<h1>How to find out what's new, before its new - GitHub</h1>
We are busy every day, updating issues, "commiting" code and asking each other for code reviews. To add features, ask questions or leave us notes you can use our GitHub issue tracker:

<h1>June 1 2012 - Week 6 - Testing the modules</h1>
<p>This week we are writing the testing code which specifieds what functions the module must complete. Tests serve as <a href="">documentation</a> for what each class (you can think of classes as module) does. Tests also serve as sample client code for future developers when they want to use the modules, they can look at the module's tests to how to use the module's functionality.</p>
<p>We also set up a testing environment for embedding widgets such as {DataList Widget, Data Search Widget, Activity Feed Widget} <a href="http://ilanguage.ca/about/about-ilanguage-lab/fieldlinguistics-web-widgets/">into a WordPress post</a>. 
Note, the testing post is private, use password "fieldlinguistics" to see it. The web widgets will allow linguists to let others interact with their data on their blogs.</p>

<h1>May 18 2012 - Week 5 - Documenting the modules</h1>
<p>This week we finished the <a href="http://redmine.ilanguage.ca:8080/job/Drag-and-Drop-FieldLinguistics/javadoc/?">documentation</a> for what each class (you can think of classes as module) does. </p>
<p>We also published the <a href="https://github.com/mecathcart/Drag-and-Drop-FieldLinguistics/wiki/Software-requirements-specification">Software Requirements Specification</a> and put up a public <a href="https://github.com/mecathcart/Drag-and-Drop-FieldLinguistics/wiki">Wiki</a> page with a description, team members and non-technical details telling the world what we are up to.</p>

<h1>May 11 2012 - Week 4 - Three Black Boxes</h1>
<h2>Continuous Build Server is up: Meet our butler, Jenkins</h2>
<p>Jenkins is set up and building the project every time someone commits to GitHub. When the build fails, Jenkins emails the group (this encourages us to do code review and make sure at least two pairs of eyes see the code that get checks in.) Use your username and password that Theresa gave you to log in. We will see if we can make some of him public so anyone outside the project can also see if the builds are succeeding.
</p>
<p>
If the builds succeeds Jenkins is also continuously deploying to the actual website.

<h1>May 4 2012 - Week 3 - Gimp User Interface Designs</h1>


<p>The main dashboard can be very cluttered: have a team feed, multiple data entries, and the drop down quick search (a la spotlight), This one is the Llama skin:</p>
