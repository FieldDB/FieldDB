    "message" : "<p>An Elicitation Session is very similar to an elicitation session in the real world. This could be a 1-hour Session with one language consultant, or a 3-hour field methods class, or data from a file import. Generally an elicitation session happens on a specific day, or across a few days, you can write a date or text in the 'dateElicited' field. Often we have a goal set out when we meet for an elicitation Session, if you want, you can put this into the 'Goal' field of the Sessions and it will appear in the Session quick links below. An Elicitation Session has many fields which you can edit by clicking on the <i class='icon-comments-alt'></i> icons in the app to see the details. These fields are information which is common to all datum elicited that day for example, the dialect, perhaps the language consultants present the date etc. The Session fields are copied into the Datum that were elicited during that Session, this makes it possible to search for Datum containing a particular dialect and/or speaker etc. </p>"

  "locale_datalists_explaination" : {
    "message" : "<p>A Datalist is a collection of Datum that you put together for a reason, it could be to prepare  a handout, to share some of your data with someone, to export into another program or simply to keep track of similar Datum for your research. You could think of Datalists as curated search results that the app remembers for you. Datalists have titles and descriptions, their titles appear as links below. You can click on the links to see the details of the  Datalist. In the Datalist view, the Datum will appear in the colour of their current state (i.e. Checked with a consultant, To be checked, Deleted etc). You can make new states in the Datum State Settings on this page. You can create new Datalists by doing a search for what you want to be in the Datalist. You can refine the Datalist items by clicking on <i class='icon-remove-sign'></i> to remove Datum in the Datalist view. The Datalist view is normally on the left side of your dashboard, you can see it by double clicking on a Datalist in the list below. If you want to see all your data click on the 'All Data' link below, this will load all your data into a Datalist view. If you have over 200 Datum in your corpus, this can be pretty slow. If you have a large corpus you may prefer searching for a subset of your data rather than skimming all of it at once. In general, any Datalist with more than 100 Datum takes a few seconds to load and display all the Datum it contains. </p>"

Add users to the 'Writers' group if you want to let them add comments, enter new data, change Datum State from 'to be checked to 'checked' etc. For example, if you would like to allow your language consultant to enter or check data, you can put them in the 'writers' group. Add users to the 'Readers' group if you want them to be able to see your data, but not modify it. For example, you might want to share your data with other researchers outside of your team, but you might not want them to leave comments or modify , or mass-export the data. If you want to make your corpus public and findable on Google as recommended by EMLED data management best practices, click the Public checkbox. Don't worry, if your corpus contains confidential or personal information you can, and should, encrypt the Datum containing sensitive information using the <i class=' icon-unlock'></i> buttons. Data which are encrypted are shown as 'xxx xx xx xx' to all users, including on the web.

    "message" : "<p>Datum Fields are fields which where you can add information about your Datum. There fields are automatically detected when you import data, so if you have data already, you should import it to save you time configuring your corpus. As defaults the app comes with 4 fields which it uses to create inter-linear-glossed text views (i.e. pretty view which you are used to seeing in books and handouts). You can add any number of fields (we have tested using over 400 fields). In the Datum Edit view, the fields that are used most frequently in your corpus will automatically appear when you open a Datum, and you can click on <i class='icon-list-alt '> </i> to see the rare fields. The fields in your corpus (shown below) are automatically available in the search. You can choose to encrypt particular fields (e.g. utterance). If you mark a Datum as confidential, the encrypted fields will be encrypted in the database and masked from the user as 'xxx xx xxxxx'. For example, you may choose to not encrypt a lambda calculus field, or a grammatical notes field, as these are usually purely a linguistic formalism and may not transmit any personal information which your consultants would like to keep confidential. Each Datum Fields can have a help convention, which is the text you see below. Your team members can see these help/conventions by clicking the <i class='icon-question-sign'></i> next to the Datum Field label in the Datum Edit view. These help conventions are also exported as a README.txt when you export your data, as recommended by EMELD data management best practices. </p>"

You can assign colours to your Datum States, these colours will appear in your data list. You can flag a Datum as Deleted and it won't show up in search results. A Datum in a corpus is never really deleted, it remains in the database complete with its change history so that you can review it at a later date.

    "message" : "<p>There are two ways to access Search, you can type in your query in the search box which is always present on the top left of the screen, or you can click on the button next to it to get to the Advanced Search. Search is very important to field linguists, this is why we made the Search very powerful, and we are planning on making it more powerful in the future. You can type any string of characters in the Datum or Session Fields below. The search will look through the datum of your corpus, and find datum which contain that substring, this means you can type 'nay' and you will get morphemes 'onay' 'naya' etc. While this is not ideal for finding allomorphs, it works pretty well. Right now the search is happening on your computer, offline. In the future we will be adding a 'lexicon webservice' which will work on indexing your morphemes glosses etc to make search faster, but also smarter by build a more linguistically informed indexes of your data so that you can use linguistic constructs to search for your data as you do naturally when you search with your eyes, rather than with a database. We also have planned a 'Dream' module for phonological search that essentially uses a feature geometry ontology to let you search for minimal pairs. A search automatically creates a temporary Datalist, which appears below the Session quick view on the left side of the screen. You can choose to rename and save this Datalist if created a collection of data that you wanted. You can also leave this search data list open, if you enter new datum which matched your search query that appears in the top left corner, they will automatically appear in the search data list too. This can be handy for you to see datum around a certain phenomena while you are entering new data. If your search query is hard to formulate to get all the examples you need, you can search for nothing (leave all fields blank) and it will return all your data as a new Datalist. In general we have decided to implement search such that it errs on the side of high recall, i.e. that it finds all relevant examples, but also returns some garbage, rather than high precision, i.e. that it finds only exact examples, but misses some relevant ones. Currently the search results are not sorted by relevancy to the query. Once we have a proper 'lexicon webservice' we will have more measures of relevancy and will be able to return results and their relevancy scores. </p>"
