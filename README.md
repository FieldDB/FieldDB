FieldDB is a free, modular, open source project developed collectively by field linguists and software developers to make an expandable user-friendly app which can be used to collect, search and share your data, both online and offline. It is fundamentally an app written in 100% Javascript which runs entirely client side, backed by a NoSQL database (we are currently using CouchDB and its offline browser wrapper PouchDB alpha). It has a number of webservices which it connects to in order to allow users to perform tasks which require the internet/cloud (ie, syncing data between devices and users, sharing data publicly, running CPU intensive processes to analyze/extract/search audio/video/text). While the app was fundamentally designed for field linguists it can be used by anyone collecting text data or collecting highly structured data where the fields on each data point require encryption or customization from user to user.

FieldDB beta was officially launched in English and Spanish on August 1st 2012 in Patzun, Guatemala as an [app for fieldlinguists](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lingsync/ocmdknddgpmjngkhcbcofoogkommjfoj).

# Related repositories

These are the webservices which the FieldDB client uses, and which make up the complete FieldDB suite. If you fork the project, you might also be intersted in forking these repositories and adapting them to your needs. We created two scripts to simplify the process of downloading and building the FieldDB dependancies into what we call an fielddbworkspace.
