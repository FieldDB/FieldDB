iField: An offline/online fieldlinguistics database which adapts to its user's I-Language.

# What is iField?
iField is a free, open source project developed collectively by field linguists and software developers to make a modular, user-friendly app which can be used to collect, search and share your data.

# Who can I use iField with?
* iField is a Chrome app, which means it works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPad, and also offline.
* Multiple collaborators can add to the same corpus, and you can encrypt any piece of data, keep it private within your corpus, or make it public to share with the community and other researchers.

# How can iField save me time?
iField uses machine learning and computational linguistics to adapt to your existing organization of the data which you import and predict how to gloss it. iField already supports import and export of many common formats, including ELAN, Praat, Toolbox, FLEx, Filemaker Pro, LaTeX, xml, csv and more, but if you have another format you'd like to import or export, Contact Us.

# What are the principles behind iField?
We designed iField from the ground up to be user-friendly, but also to conform to EMELD and DataOne best practices on formatting, archiving, open access, and security. For more information, see the data management sections of our white paper. We vow never to use your private data, you can find out more in our privacy policy.

# Call for Beta Testers

iField beta was officially launched in English and Spanish on August 2st 2012 in Patzun, Guatemala. So far we have had input from fieldlinguists working on Morpho-syntax, LF and Prosody. We are looking for more beta testers who would like to try out our app as a Beta Tester. In particular we need to know if the app is user-friendly, and if you have suggestions on how we can improve the app to save you time entering your data, and searching for your data when writing handouts/articles etc. 

So put on your best fieldlinguist's cargo pants, and [join us for the bug hunt!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFlXWENNd1FXRmxPOTl1NVVqemc2ZlE6MQ)
