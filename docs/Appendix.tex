\section {List of known programmers}

The appendix contains short bios of  programmers who have worked on the FieldDB project. You can use these bios if you need to hire someone to work on on a module for you. We also encourage you to hire your students and RAs as "interns" who will be trained by us on how they can adapt the project to your needs. If you want to be hired to work on FieldDB send us your bio, we will include it here.

\subsection{Theresa Deering M.Sc.}

Theresa Deering has a  Bachelor's in Computer Science from Malaspina and a Master's in Computer Science from McGill University. She began her academic career in Mathematics and has since won the Governor General's Academic Medal twice, as well as held numerous NSERC scholarships throughout her academic career. Her programming experience ranges from obscure machine learning algorithms to interactive web development.  She is an active OpenSource contributor to BigData database implementations for offline WebApp databases. Her thesis focused on the Least-Used Direction pivot rule for the Simplex Method of solving linear programs.

\section {List of interns - Fall 2012}


\subsection{Hisako Noguchi M.A.}

Hisako completed her masters in linguistics at Concordia University in 2011 and is now working as an RA for Alan Bale. This is her second internship with the FieldDB project. She classifies herself as "not a programmer" which makes her very good at explaining programming techniques and tools to linguists. She is also very nice and helpful.
