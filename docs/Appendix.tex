\section {List of known programmers}

The appendix contains short bios of  programmers who have worked on the FieldDB project.

\subsection{Theresa Deering M.Sc.}

Theresa Deering has a  Bachelor's in Computer Science from Malaspina and a Master's in Computer Science from McGill University. She began her academic career in Mathematics and has since won the Governor General's Academic Medal twice, as well as held numerous NSERC scholarships throughout her academic career. Her programming experience ranges from obscure machine learning algorithms to interactive web development.  She is an active OpenSource contributor to BigData database implementations for offline WebApp databases. Her thesis focused on the Least-Used Direction pivot rule for the Simplex Method of solving linear programs.
