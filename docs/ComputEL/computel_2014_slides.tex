\note{Hello everyone. My name is Joel and this is Gina.}
\note[item]{We are here to talk to you today about LingSync and the
Online Linguistic Database.}
\note[item]{These are open source web-based tools that facilitate fieldwork
    and collaborative approaches to fieldwork on endangered languages.}
\note[item]{Our initial goal in this presentation is to provide you
with an overview of the two systems.}
\note[item]{However, we are at a transition point since we are beginning to
    merge these two tools under the LingSync name and are very interested in
    getting feedback on our approach from you, our learned peers, who have
    thought much about these issues; in general, we're very excited to be here
    to be part of the discussion about how computational tools and
    computational linguistic advances can benefit fieldwork on endangered
    languages.}

% FIELDWORK
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection[Fieldwork]{Endangered languages fieldwork}\label{sec:fieldwork}


% CONTEXT
%===============================================================================

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Context}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Context of rapid language loss (Harrison 2007, Krauss 1992)
    \item Language diversity and vitality are valuable scientifically,
        culturally, and socially (Hallett et al. 2007)
    \item Computational approaches and formalisms can benefit fieldwork
        (Bird 2009)
    %\item Important differences (Crippen \& Robinson 2013)
\end{itemize}
\note[item]{So, it hardly needs to be stated that we are in a situation where
    a significant portion of the world's languages are predicted to be extinct,
    or "sleeping" to use a more optimistic jargon, in the very near future.}
\note[item]{Linguistic diversity and language vitality are valuable from a
    number of perspectives. For those who might be sceptical of a strong link
    between language vitality and social well-being, the Hallett et al. (2007)
    reference may be interesting: it describes a study which finds a
    correlation between higher levels of Aboriginal language use in British
    Columbia First Nations bands and lower youth suicide rates.}
\note[item]{And clearly we're all here because we think that computational
    approaches can contribute in interesting and useful ways to the
    documentation, study, and/or revitalization of endangered languages.}

\end{frame}


% DEBATES
%===============================================================================

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Debates}
\begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Documentation, description, and/or theoretical analysis?
        \note[item]<1>{There are a number of ongoing debates that are relevant
            here.}
        \note[item]<1>{First, there is some disagreement over how we should
            approach the urgent problem of language endangerement.}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2->Less description, more documentation, more recording, more
                community involvement! (Woodbury 2003, Bird et al. 2014)
                \note[item]<2>{Some argue that we should focus on documentation,
                    on recording speech, respeakings, and translations, and on
                    generating artifacts for future study.}
                \item<3->Better description can prevent “data graveyards”
                    (Gippert et al. 2006, cf. Beale 2014)
                \note[item]<3>{Others point out that we can use computational
                    tools and CL advances to expedite language description and
                    analysis; this way we can avoid an unfortunate eventuality
                    which sees a bunch of data that nobody can make sense of.}
            \item<4->Theoretical linguistic analysis uncovers previously
                unknown generalizations (Murray 2014)
                \note[item]<4>{There is a related debate over the role of
                    theoretical linguistic analysis here, with some typologists
                    advocating a descriptive approach and theoretical linguists
                    responding in defense of a hypothesis-driven approach and its
                    attendant elicitation methods---i.e., translation from the metalanguage
                    and the gathering of grammaticality judgments---that are controversial
                    to some. In a recent paper in support of the theoretical
                    linguistic side of this debate, Sarah Murray argues, convincingly
                    in my estimation, that hypothesis-driven fieldwork
                    involving the elicitation of negative data can lead to the
                    discovery of significant generalizations that, under a
                    purely descriptive approach, would remain hidden.}
        \end{itemize}
    \item<5->A duty to collaborate?
        \note[item]<5>{A related debate asks whether the various types of
            endangered language fieldworker have a duty to collaborate and,
            relatedly, whose agenda should be given priority.}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<6->Community agenda paramount; imperative to collaborate (Gerdts 2010)
                \note[item]<6>{At one extreme lies the view that the goals of
                    linguist fieldworkers should be subordinated to those of language
                    communities.}
            \item<7->Lone wolf linguistics is not necessarily unethical linguistics (Crippen \& Robinson 2013)
                \note[item]<7>{Others point out that, for a variety of reasons,
                    this is not always possible or desirable. The contexts of language
                    endangerement are themselves diverse. Not all communities desire or
                    are genuinely committed to documentation or revitalization. Not all
                    communities need or desire the help of academic fieldworkers. In some
                    cases, the political landscape of an endangered language
                    community is just too complex for a field linguist to navigate. In
                    these types of situations, the best course of action for all parties
                    involved may be for linguist fieldworkers to respectfully
                    and ethically pursue their own research agenda.}
        \end{itemize}
    \item<8->Whatever we decide, let's maximize openness, access, and the sharing and reuse
        of both data and functionality
        \note[item]<8>{These are complex and relevant issues. However, to a certain
            extent the LingSync/OLD approach can sidestep them. The attitude we advocate
            is something along the lines of "can't we all just get along?". We want to
            help contribute towards an infrastructure which facilitates, but does not
            require, collaboration between stakeholders, an infrastructure which is
            flexible and general enough to be useful to different types of linguist
            and fieldworker. We want to help fieldworkers to make their data more useful
            to their peers.}

\subsection[Requirements]{Software requirements}


% REQUIREMENTS
%===============================================================================

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Requirements}
\note[item]<1>{So here we will briefly review the requirements that guided
    the development of LingSync and the OLD.}
\note[item]<1>{We are not claiming that our tools fully meet all of these
    requirements. These are goals we have been and are presently working
    towards.}

\begin{uncoverenv}<2->
\begin{requirement}
\label{req:primary-data}
Integration of primary data
\end{requirement}
\end{uncoverenv}
\note[item]<2>{The software must be able to handle primary data. In particular,
    we need to help fieldworkers share audio and video recordings (including
    experimental stimuli). The system should allow for the alignment of
    audio/video with transcriptions and other textual data; the audio/video and
    textual data should be displayed simultaneously for easy cross-reference.
    It should be possible to record audio right into the application and, if
    possible, the text/audio alignment process should be automated or partially
    automated.}

\begin{uncoverenv}<3->
\begin{requirement}
\label{req:curation}
Curation of data
\end{requirement}
\end{uncoverenv}
\note[item]<3>{The system should facilitate the curation of data, that is, its
    iterative and collaborative refinement over time. For example, the
    initial output of elicitation could be simply an audio recording and a
    transcription of salient forms. Then, subsequent waves of data curation can
    involve transcription at various levels and/or the creation of
    morphological analyses and annotations of various types, for example,
    tagging and categorizing. Various automations of the data curation process
    are possible.}


\begin{uncoverenv}<4->
\begin{requirement}
\label{req:inclusive}
Inclusion of stakeholders
\end{requirement}
\end{uncoverenv}
\note[item]<4>{The software should allow for the inclusion of the various
    stakeholders in the endangered languages fieldwork enterprise. That is, the
    software should be useful to linguists with various types of expertise and
    agendas (e.g., theoretical, typological, historical, computational), to
    other types of academic researchers (e.g., to anthropologists), to
    interested community members, and to fieldworkers enganged in
    community-based documentation, education, and revitalization projects.}


\begin{uncoverenv}<5->
\begin{requirement}
\label{req:openable}
Openable data
\end{requirement}
\end{uncoverenv}
\note[item]<5>{The system should allow fieldworkers to produce open data. That
    is, data that are available for reuse via various GUIs and APIs. The system
    should also be configurable such that access to portions of the data can be
    restricted in accordance with the requirements of speakers and communities,
    if necessary.}


\begin{uncoverenv}<6->
\begin{requirement}
\label{req:productivity}
User productivity
\end{requirement}
\end{uncoverenv}
\note[item]<6>{The system should contribute to user productivity. It should
    include well-designed user interfaces as well as conveniences which expedite
    repetitive tasks. It should also help with tasks that are particular to
    linguistic fieldwork such as the creation of sophisticated searches over the
    data sets.}

\note[item]{The core components are the corpus web service where the
    bulk of user data are stored and the two primary GUIs---the Spreadsheet
    web application and the Prototype online/offline Chrome app---which
    mediate user interaction with the corpus web service.}
\note[item]{The audio web service can make lossy copies of large files,
    can identify utterances within large files, and can align transcriptions
    and audio files using another tool called the ProsodyLab-Aligner.}
\note[item]{The parser component depicted here is the OLD's morphological
    parser functionality which we plan to plug in to LingSync. This component

\note[item]{Portions of a corpus can be encrypted at a fine-grained level
    if that kind of control over access is required.}
\note[item]{Finally, LingSync implements version control, meaning that all

    this is an important feature in the context of collaborative data creation.}

    difference between the two systems is that the OLD assumes that users will

    to create private corpora that they can grant various levels of access to.}

        \end{itemize}
    \item LingSync and OLD
        \begin{itemize}
            \item datum/form is primary

        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\note[item]<1>{Note that the data structures assumed by LingSync and the OLD
    are arguably more general than those of similar applications like FLEx and
    Toolbox.}
\note[item]<1>{This greater generality allows these tools to be useful to a wider
    range of fieldworkers.}
\note[item]<1>{Under the LingSync/OLD conception, the fundamental unit of data is
    something quite unconstrained which in LingSync is called a "datum" and in
    the OLD is called a "form".}
\note[item]<1>{This abstract data unit may be used to represent sentences, phrases,
    words, or morphemes.}
\note[item]<1>{Texts, corpora, and records of elicitation sessions can then be
    constructed as (possibly ordered) sets of these data points.}
\note[item]<1>{Similarily, grammars can be created as texts which embed via reference
    these data points. And dictionaries could be constructed from these units as
    well.}
\note[item]<2>{This contrasts with the data structures that underpin FLEx and
    Toolbox; these tools assume that a grammar and a dictionary with supporting
    texts are the ultimate goals of the fieldworkers who use them. However,
    this is not always the case.}

Goals
\begin{itemize}
    \item Present and motivate the OLD's approach to creating morphological parsers
    \item Demonstrate the use of this functionality via two Blackfoot parsers
\end{itemize}
\note[item]{Now I'd like to discuss the OLD's morphological parser functionality. I
    will present and motivate the OLD's approach to creating morphological
    parsers with reference to two parsers created for Blackfoot, an endangered
    language which is from the Algonquian language family and which is spoken
    in Alberta, Canada and Montana, USA.}
\note[item]{This portion of our presentation should segue nicely into the next talk
    which discusses a similar but interestingly different approach to modeling
    the morphology and phonology of another Algonquian language: Plains Cree.}

\frametitle{OLD Morphological Parsers}
Requirements (fieldworkers should be able to):
\note[item]<1>{Here are the requirements that guided the design of the OLD's
    functionality for creating morphological parsers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item create parsers that
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1->are practical and forgiving
                \note[item]<1>{Fieldworkers should be able to create
                    morphological parsers that are practical and forgiving.  By
                    \textit{practical} I mean that they should be able to
                    suggest correct, or largely correct, word analyses during
                    data entry. (High recall.) By \textit{forgiving} I mean that I want
                    fieldworkers to be able to create parsers without first
                    having a full and perfect analysis of the morphophonology
                    of their language of study.}
            \item<2->make use of existing fieldworker skills
                \note[item]<2>{Since fieldworkers are being encouraged to create
                    their own parsers, they should be able to do so by making use
                    of the skills that they already have. That is, they should not
                    be required to first learn wholly unfamiliar formalisms.}
            \item<3->make use of data in the system
                \note[item]<3>{Fieldworkers should be able to build parsers
                    using the expertly analyzed data that already exist in ther
                    databases; for example, morphologically analyzed words in
                    IGT format and categorized and phonemically transcribed
                    lexical entries.}
            \item<4->are tailored to a specific purpose
                \note[item]<4>{Fieldworkers should be able to create different
                    parsers for different purposes. Examples include orthographic
                    parsers which parse orthographic transcriptions and phonetic
                    parsers which parse phonetic transcriptions. It should also
                    be possible to tailor phonetic parsers to the grammars of
                    individual speakers or dialects. Fieldworkers should also
                    be able to create analysis-specific variants of all of
                    these.}
            \item<5->facilitate automated analysis testing
                \note[item]<5>{Since the parsers are comprised of computational
                    implementations of analyses and models of the lexicon,
                    morphology, and phonology, they should facilitate the
                    automated testing of these analyses and models against
                    specified data sets in the system.}
            \item<6->are reusable: spell-checkers, pronunciation dictionaries, \ldots
                \note[item]<6>{The components of the parsers should be reusable for,
                    say, the creation of spell-checkers or the generation of
                    pronunciation dictionaries that can be used in

            familiar with, the system makes use of existing fieldworker skills.}
        \note[item]<4>{The second line in (\getref{phonology}), for example, is
            a rule which transforms the hyphen morpheme delimiter to an "s" when
            it occurs after a "t" and before an "i". A fieldworker can immediately
            begin using this formalism after learning a few simple notational
            oddities, such as the use of double vertical lines in place of the
            forward slash that is customary in rule-based phonology texts.}
    \item<5->facilitate automated analysis testing
        \note[item]<5>{Also, since the fieldworker has full control over the
            definition of phonological transformations (or spelling rules),
            they can use the functionality to test their analyses of this
            component of the grammar. For example, the parser can be used to
            automate the discovery of words in the database that its
            morphophonology cannot analyze; This may lead to modifications of
            the underlying analyses and models.}
        \note[item]<5>{One restricted but useful example of automated analysis
            testing is provided by the phonology test comment beneath the
            phonology definition. The left side of the arrow is the underlying
            representation and the right side is the surface representation.
            The OLD recognizes these comments in FST rewrite rule scripts and
            reports back on what percentage of the tests are passed by the
            phonology. This facilitates test-driven phonology development.}

                    category and delimiter sequences that correspond to valid
                    words of the language, were extracted from the 3,414 well
                    analyzed word types in the Blackfoot OLD. Well analyzed
                    words are those with fieldworker-created morphological
                    analyses such that all of the morphemes used have lexical

                \note[item]<4>{The morpheme language models were estimated
                    based on counts from the set of well analyzed words in the
                    database such that a single best analysis can be
                    identified. This is the gold standard used for both LM creation
                    and evaluation. Each parser was created five times with a
                    different randomly sampled 90\% training set and overall
                    parser performance was tested against the corresponding

        grammar (Frantz 1997)
        \note[item]<5>{The two parsers differ in their phonologies. Parser 1
            has a phonology which implements, as faithfully as I could manage,
            the general phonological rules of the grammar and the lexically
            conditioned allomorphic alternations described in that same text.}
    \item<6->Parser 2: Parser 1's phonology with length and prominence
        contrasts removed during generation; massively over-analyzes
        \note[item]<6>{Parser 2 is an attempt to improve on Parser 1 by
            modifying the phonology so that it recognizes many more surface
            forms. During generation, this phonology maps long segments to
            their short counterparts and de-accents accented characters.
            Orthographically transcribed words must be de-accented and
            de-lengthened prior to parsing attempts.}

\label{tab:p2-results}
\end{table}

\note[item]<1>{This table summarizes the results of evaluating these parsers.}
\note[item]<1>{While neither has a very impressive overall success rate---14\% and
    17\%, respectively---their F-scores show that they will be practical in
    expediting the creation of IGT representations. With a GUI that presents
    a ranked list of parses during data entry, fieldworker-contributors will
    be able to edit auto-generated parses that contain, roughly and on average,
    half of the correct morphemes.}
\note[item]<1>{Also, the morphophonology transducer of Parser 2 is 60\%
    accurate, meaning that 60\% of the time the correct analysis is in the
    candidate set that it returns.  Therefore users could scroll through the
    ranked list of candidates and choose the correct one; which would be faster
    than typing it out manually.}
\note[item]<2>{The phonology of Parser 1 has a 21\% success rate while that of
    Parser 2 has a 60\% success rate. There are two primary explanations for
    the poor performance of Parser 1's phonology, i.e., that which is faithful
    to the grammar. First, the grammar's phonology does not account for
    non-lexical prominence, i.e., accenting. Second, there is a lot of
    inconsistency in terms of orthographic transcription in this
    multi-contributor data set.}
\note[item]<3>{It is interesting that the phonology of Parser 2 performs so much
    better yet the gains in overall parse rate and F-score are not as
    significant. Parser 2 essentially puts a far greater burden on the language
    model, a burden which is too much for an LM based on counts from an extremely
    small corpus of 3,400 words. Parser 2's morphophonology transducer produces
    approximately 1,800 analysis candidates per input word. As more well
    analyzed words are added to the database with the aid of the parsers, the
    LM will improve and, as a result, so too will the parser as a whole.}
\note[item]<4>{Of course, another means of improving overall performance would
    be to improve the performance of the phonology without causing it to
    massively overgenerate during analysis and put such a burden on the LM,
    that is, by using fieldworker knowledge to write a phonology that can
    predict the location of accented vowels. This is in the works.}

\frametitle{OLD Morphological Parsers \char"2012{} Discussion}

OLD parsers exemplify a particular set of principles for guiding
computationally-assisted endangered languages fieldwork:
\note[item]<1>{The OLD approach to creating morphological parsers illustrates
    some general strategies that I would like to advocate in terms of
    computationally-assisted fieldwork on endangered languages.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item<2->exploit both fieldworker expertise and automated methods of
        grammar induction
        \note[item]<2>{We need systems that can both make use of the expertise
            of the fieldworkers who are creating these data sets, while also
            helping them to bootstrap the process with statistical and machine
            learning techniques. This is interestingly different from NLP where
            the overarching requirement would seem to be the production of
            results with as little expert guidance as one can get away with.}
        \note[item]<2>{By allowing fieldworkers real control over the
            specification of models, we not only make use of that skill set, we
            also make it easier for them to automate the testing of their
            analyses, and thereby to improve those analyses.}
        \note[item]<2>{At the same time, we should be forgiving, i.e., we
            should not REQUIRE a complete mastery of components of the grammar
            prior to the creation of useful features like automatic
            morphological analyzers.}
        \item<3->use familiar representations:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item yes: (nit-ihpiyi, 1-dance, agra-vai)
                \item no: ihpiyi+1+SG+PST
            \end{itemize}
        \note[item]<3>{We should also create systems that make use of representations
            that are familiar to fieldworkers. This has already been mentioned with
            respect to SPE-style context-sensitive rewrite rules in the specification
            of phonologies. Another example of this, however, can be seen in the
            fact that OLD parsers return morphological analyses in IGT format, i.e.,
        a morpheme segmentation line, a gloss line, and a category line.}
    \item<4->allow for multiple models
        \note[item]<4>{We need to also enable fieldworkers to implement different
            models for different purposes. In some situations, prescriptive models
            are needed such as orthographic parsers that can parse orthographic
            transcriptions and which can be used, for example, in the creation of
            spell-checkers. In other situations, descriptive models of various types
            are needed. For example, speaker-, dialect-, and/or analysis-specific
            models that can analyze and generate phonetic representations and which
            can be used to test analyses and, for example, to create
            pronunciation dictionaries for audio-to-text alignment tools.}
