			<li>Offline: Fieldlinguists rarely have internet</li>
			<li>Data intensive: Fieldlinguists would import the web, if they
				could</li>
			<li>Highly-structured: Fieldlinguists are super structured, but
				never the same structure and the structure of the data usually
				evolves over time as their analysis evolves and the data they
				collect grows.</li>
			<li>Encrypted: Fieldlinguist's are bound to laws on the
				protection of 'human subjects' which means some data needs to be
				confidential, until the subject's death. This means encryption in
				the database and decrypting only after authentication. An
				interesting problem for an offline app where no code or tokens can
				be hidden from the user...</li>
			<li>CPU intensive: Fieldlinguists have lots of repetitive tasks
				and OpenSource projects which automate them, we use Node.js to bring
				these in as web services.</li>
			<li>Web widgets: Fieldlinguists want to share their data, but
				not all of it. Mash ups and mashability are what's missing from
				existing fieldlinguistics database software..</li>

	<h2>What do we mean by Offline?</h2>
	<ul class="incremental">
		<li>Online</li>
		<li>Online and Offline/cached</li>
		<li>Only Offline</li>
	</ul>
	<div role="note">Most Javascript apps are not offline, they're
		online in constant contact with a web server. Others are online and
		can go offline for a period of time by living out of a cache. In our
		case we are talking about completely offline. Files are delivered in
		the first download of the app, and they persist (along with their
		storage) even after the user has uninstalled the app (in the case of a
		Chrome extension, or Android). Sure, the app has a few buttons which
		make REST calls to a web service, but only when the user wants to
		connect.</div>

		<p>Our App is designed to run on a couple of clients, namely a
			Chrome extension, an Android tablet and in a limited capacity, on a
			website. There are 4 web services: Authentication,
			AudioSplicing/Transcription, Search/MachineLearning, Database and a
			webserver, 4 are Node.js and one is CouchDB itself.</p>
		<p>We are using Backbone, Handlebars, Require.js to manage
			dependencies and PouchDB which wraps IndexedDB. In this talk we are
			going to look at two key libraries and their pitfalls which we think
			might help you guys out, if you have similar stack.</p>

	<h3>Vanilla Backbone Models (url or urlRoot property)</h3>

	<div role="note">We expect most of you have done or seen some
		Backbone or similar framework so we wont bore you with the details,

		your data is headed to..</div>

<section>
	<h3>
		Using <a href="https://github.com/jo/backbone-pouchdb">backbone-pouchdb</a>
		(pouch property)
	</h3>
	<script
		src="https://gist.github.com/3790182.js?file=vanilla-pouchdb-backbone.js"></script>

	<h3>Changing a Model's PouchDB with backbone-pouchdb (functions)</h3>
	<script
		src="https://gist.github.com/3790182.js?file=extended-pouchdb-backbone.js"></script>
	<div role="note">In our case, this wasn't enough... Because we
		had models whose pouch was unknown when they were loaded we added a
		new function "changePouch" which woudl let us save and fetch a model
		from one IndexedDB to another.</div>

	<h3>The eval problem</h3>
	<script class="incremental"
		src="https://gist.github.com/3785402.js?file=eval-problem.js"></script>
	<div role="note">By far the most exciting hurdle getting an alpha
		library to run in a chrome extension was the eval problem. Eval is
		evil, but sometimes a necesary evil. This is a line in Pouch which
		takes in your Map function (so you can search in your database), which
		is stored as a doc (i.e. string) in your database, and evaluates it
		into code so it can be called. The best part is that Chrome extensions
		can no longer call eval. So what good is a database if you cant search
		it? And because the eval has to be called in the scope where the emit
		function is defined, avoiding the eval requires a redesign of PouchDB.
		So here is our hack...</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Our hack</h3>
	<ol class="incremental">
		<li>Hardcode the Map and Reduce functions where emit is in scope</li>
		<li>Compare the desired function against the hardcoded versions</li>
		<li>Assign the hardcoded version to fun.map</li>
	</ol>
	<div role="note">We put together an object containing the
		functions needed in our database for client side (we have some that
		are just for webservices, training etc...). We do string match on
		these functions compared to the function in the doc and call the
		function that string matches. No eval problem, but still a hack and
		requires putting code into the PouchDB library.</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Our hack</h3>
	<script src="https://gist.github.com/3785402.js?file=eval-hack.js"></script>
	<div role="note">Here are the 10 lines of code we had to bury
		deep on line 2308 of pouch.alpha.js</div>

	<blockquote>RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module
		loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in
		other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node.</blockquote>
	<div role="note">Turning now to modularity and code-reuse. Using
		a script loader like RequireJS drastically reduced the complexity of
		developing and deploying our codebase for multiple clients.</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Why Require.js?</h2>
	<ul class="incremental">
		<li>Easier development using only local dependencies</li>
		<li>Smarter minification</li>
		<li>Better for building "widgets"</li>
	</ul>
	<div role="note">Require.js makes for cleaner classes, if you're
		used to developing in Java, having Require makes you feel right at
		home. Require.js calculates the files your class depends on and
		includes them for you. Require can also 'build' your classes into a
		minified js file for shipping down the wire, whether it be on page
		load for a website, or when the user downloads your app from the
		Android market. Similarly require helps for building a subset of the
		codebase i.e. for building an activity feed widget which your users
		can embed in their WordPress, website etc.</div>

	<h2>The CommonJS Debate</h2>

		Getting libraries (Backbone, Underscore, JQuery)<br /> to <a
			href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8131265/loading-backbone-and-underscore-using-requirejs">play
			nice</a><br /> with Require.js ...
	</p>

	<div role="note">As far as we can see there's a clear political
		divide between two camps of Javascript developers. Here's what we can
		pull away from it. One camp thinks you do/should always build and
		therefore you don't need to use a module loader in development, and
		one camp doesn't. Libraries from one camp dont (didn't) play nice with
		libraries of others... Specifically getting Underscore/Backbone and
		JQuery to play nice with Require.js has been a give-up point for a lot
		of devs. We don't know much about the politics but there was a release
		or two where underscore and backbone were AMD compliant but then it
		was removed for some reason "As of version 1.3.0 Underscore removed
		AMD (RequireJS) support."
