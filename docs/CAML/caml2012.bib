%constantly changing hypotheses about how to appropriately analyze a language

%asic computational skills like scripting and data management can be very effective in improving the quality and consistency of data annotated in language documentation projects, as well as increasing the data?s suitability for reuse, both by humans and by machines.

%a solid software infrastructure is necessary. This infrastructure must take into account both machine and hu- man factors.
