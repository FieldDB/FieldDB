\section*{Executive Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary}

The Software Design Document serves as a bridge between what the user wants the software to do, and what the developers need to program.

We are using Scrum development practices which focus on delivering something to the users every two weeks, and documenting our code using tests rather than a traditional Software Design Document (SDD).

The software design is documented on the fly and across time in our Issue Tracker. Each issue represents a user story or a feature, or a bug. Searching the Issue tracker and our milestones are the best place to get an idea of what the software is designed to do, what it does now, and what it will do.

However, it has been nearly 2 years since we began the project and the team has grown! The need to cite a technical document has also grown, as most of the sequence and ER diagrams were completed during the design phases, and haven't changed much since we are able to formally diagram them here, if someone has time :) As of February 2014, this document will be a copy paste of materials from the wiki.

\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Audience and Scope of Design}

The Audience of this document is mostly software engineering interns who would be familiar with the concept of SDD and want to see how open source software deviates from what they learned in school. The audience may also extend to programming linguists who would like to learn more about software engineering.

\subsection{Balancing user experience and data management best practices}

In the WhitePaper we discuss some of the challenges to build user friendly apps yet constrain data input to ensure data quality. When we began the project we had several non-functional requirements, available in the wiki, and pasted here for reference as we discuss the comonents, these requirements will be refered to.


Non-functional requirements put simply are overarching considerations which affect the software architecture. Non-functional requirements are where most existing field linguistics/corpus linguistics database applications fall short.

\begin{exe}

\ex  
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] Non-functional requirements which have ramifications though-out the system

\begin{enumerate}
\item The system shall be \textbf{user friendly}.
\item The system shall be \textbf{cute} so that the users feel like entering data, instead of procrastinating.
\item The system shall be \textbf{designed for search} as this is one of the most important tasks that a fieldlinguist needs to do. The search needs go far beyond traditional string matches and database indexes. We need to see data in context, and the search must attempt to make this possible. 
\item The system shall be \textbf{OpenData enabled.} Corpora often contain sensitive information, informant stories and other information which must be kept confidential. Having confidential data in plain text in a corpus forces the entire corpus to be kept confidential. The system shall encrypt confidential data and store the data in the corpus encrypted. To access the plain text the user must log in and use their password to decrypt the data. This design has important ramifications for exporting data, and for editing the data outside the app. 
\item The system shall work \textbf{offine.} Running a webapp offline has important consequences for how data is stored, and how data is retrieved, and how much data can be used while offline. Most browsers have limits on the amount of data a webapp can store offline. By delivering a version of the app in a Chrome Extension (which has permission to have unlimited storage) the user will be able to have a significant portion of their data at their finger tips, whether in the Metro, in the field, in a park or in a country where wifi is not common, which is commonly the case for where we do our field work.
\item The system shall run on \textbf{Mac, Linux, Windows} computers. By providing the app as installable Chrome Extensions, the app will run on all platforms, Mac, Linux and Windows, as well as Chrome Books. 
\item The system shall be \textbf{OpenSource}. Being OpenSource allows departments to install and customize the database app for their needs without worry that the company behind the software will disappear or stop maintaining the software. In addition, OpenSourcing the software on GitHub allows linguists with scripting/programming experience to contribute back to the software to make it more customized to their needs and their language typologies or linguistics research areas.
\item The system shall store data in \textbf{Unicode}. Encoding problems and loosing our data should be behind us in the days of unicode, however many existing fieldlinguistics databases were built in programming languages that didn't support unicode, so the unicode support is dangerously fragile.
\item The system shall be \textbf{simple}. The system is not designed to replace advanced field linguistics databases, or corpus linguistics databases. It is designed to replace Word Documents or LaTeX documents, which is a very common way fieldlinguists store data because it requires no training, doesn't require a complicated set-up for data categories,  and takes no time to add new categories.
\item The system shall be \textbf{theory free}. The system will not include categories or linguistic frameworks or theoretical constructs that must be tied to the data, however the system will make it possible for the team to set their own categories and thus tie the specific theoretical constructs they are investigating to their data. This is a different approach to many corpus databases which are motivated by typologies and language counting which place a large data-entry burden on the user, rather than letting the user gradually constrain their data entry conventions over time.
\item The system shall be \textbf{collaborative} The system shall have users and teams, and permissions for corpora which will ensure that data can be safely shared and edited by multiple users.  The corpus will be versioned so that users can track changes and revert mistakes.
\item The system shall run on \textbf{touch devices} Touch tablets are one of the easiest tools to carry to the field, they have a long battery life, they can play videos or show images for the informant to elicit complicated contexts (such as quantification and scope), they permit recording audio and video and direct publishing to YouTube or other service. Android tablets are particularly easy to program and integrate the microphone directly into the database. 
\item The system shall be \textbf{smart} The system shall try to guess what users do most often, and automate the process for them. Most importantly, predictable glossing information should be automated.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Technology in Context}

\subsection{Why now: Advances in Database and Web Technologies}
\label{appendix:technology}

Since early 2010, the term \emph{NoSQL} has lead technology news. Databases can be grouped in roughly two categories, table-like (\ref{ex:whynosql}a) (also referred to as \emph{Relational}, or \emph{SQL} databases) and document-like (\ref{ex:whynosql}b) (commonly referenced in language documentation literature  simply as \emph{XML}, and in the software industry as \emph{NoSQL}).\footnote{NoSQL is actually a broad category encompasing anything which is not SQL, including documents but also interconnected web/neuron-like data strutures.} NoSQL data stores, including simple file based systems, have always existed and in fact pre-date SQL databases. Much like field linguists and language documentation standard bodies, companies who need  scalable data management such as Google \citep{Dean:2004, Dean:2008}  Adobe \citep{Lehene:2010:Online} Facebook \citep{Borthakur:2011}  and LinkedIn \citep{Sumbaly:2013} actively resist SQL (frequently proprietary) data storage solutions  (\ref{ex:databasetrends}a) and seek open source NoSQL solutions (\ref{ex:databasetrends}b). 

By April 2012 when LingSync began, NoSQL databases had matured to the extent that they were well understood, and deployed at large scale. 
Using an existing mature NoSQL database solution has greatly reduced the novel code needed to build LingSync, meaning we were able to focus our efforts on building usable user interfaces, and integrating our favourite field linguistics tools as modules and plugins to help automate the data entry process.

\begin{exe}

  \ex   Currently human resources are very expensive while hardware is inexpensive, resulting in a growing popularity of NoSQL databases including what is under LingSync (CouchDB)
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/databasetrends}

\label{ex:databasetrends}
\end{exe}


In June 2012, only one month before we launched the project at CAML, it became possible to build a web app which also worked offline. 
%\footnote{To develop LingSync we had been using a developer edition of Chrome which was two months before normal Chrome.}
 In April 2013 CouchDB added CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support,  permitting what are called `mashups' essentially the ability for one to build  independent apps which interfaces with LingSync data securely in realtime, with no additional infrastructure. 

Prior to 2011 there is one other aspect of LingSync which was not possible: only one programming language is used throughout LingSync. The web services are written in JavaScript, the user interface is written in JavaScript, and even the database queries are written in JavaScript. JavaScript has a very simple yet consistent syntax, and only a handful of data types, meaning that research assistants can learn to script in less than one week, and even design and complete their own components in one semester. JavaScript has only recently become a popular programming language, and as such there are a wealth of beginner friendly video screencasts and tutorials which are targeted at non-programmers. Prior to 2011 research assistants frequently learned Python, Bash, and Unix utilities to help clean and transform data,  in addition of course to \LaTeX  and/or Praat. Unlike professional fieldwork, research is unknown, no software can plan everything a research team might wish to do with their data.  As most research budgets are dedicated to funding students, and a growing number of linguistics students come to a department with a basic knowledge of web programming, a viable solution is ask research assistants to manipulate data in batches via scripts. Without a bit of scripting, research assistance are relegated to tasks of monotonous repetition which must be performed in a consistent manner. Training research assistants to script data manipulation not only saves time, but also permits labs to pass on technical knowledge to future lab members, rather than outsourcing  data management to external consultants or computer science students who have largely been trained on SQL best practices which contradict the best practices  needed for smooth data management of the NoSQL data inherent in fieldwork. \cite{Thieberger:2012} also advocates in-house learning, ``there is a need for data management skills to be developed among linguistic scholars so that our relatively small collections can be maintained.''% \citep[p.133]{}   

%It is also worth noting the ability of primary video and audio data to reside in the same system as text data has matured and is as of 2012 is mature enough on all laptops in the form of HTML5 audio and video. \citep{Pfeiffer:2010}.

\section{Module Implementations}

In this section we discuss in detail the timeline and budget for each of the modules that make up the LingSync application. The modules are grouped into core modules and dream modules which will be made when the budget becomes available. 

\label{sec:modules}
\subsection{Core Modules}

The project has three core modules which must be developed prior to additional modules. These are the {\it collaboration, corpus} and {\it lexicon} modules, briefly outlined in terms of functionality and timeline in the following sections.  Implementation of the three core modules began on April 20th 2012. The three core modules will be launched on August 1st at CAML in Patzun Guatemala. We estimate the three core modules and the software architecture to take 9.2 weeks to complete with three software developers,  and cost roughly \$23,800 before taxes. We will have its final time and costs on August 3rd 2012.


\newpage
\subsubsection{Collaboration Module}
The collaboration module shown in Table~\ref{table-collaboration}  deals with users, teams, permissions, user authentication,  as well as allowing users to see changes, modifications, and data verification in the form of an ``Activity Feed.'' An activity feed is a common design pattern which allows users to learn form other users how to use the software, what are popular functions other users are completing in addition to being a central location to update oneself on the activity in the corpus. The system will have special users called ``bot'' which are scripts or programs which power users can write in Javascript which will crawl their corpus and clean/automate batch actions.

We estimate the total cost of the collaboration module to be around \$5,700 before taxes. The implementation of the collaboration module was begun on April 20th 2012, and finished on August 1st 2012, with the exception of Team Feed and Team Preference Widgets. 
%User/Consultant/Team tests are not done either.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Corpus Module}
The corpus module shown in Table~\ref{table-corpus} deals with storing confidential data in the AES US Federal encryption standard, replicating the corpus locally on the  users' computers, as well as on a central server hosted either in the cloud, or on a linguistic department's server. The corpus module contains all of the core logic, including data fields, session fields, as well as data lists which are used to curate lists of data for handouts or publication either in linguistic articles or as web widgets embedded in external websites such as linguistic department blogs, or project pages. The corpus module is also where search of datum is implemented. 

We estimate the total cost of the corpus module to be around \$9,200 before taxes. The implementation of the corpus module was begun on April 20th 2012, and finished on August 1st 2012, with the exception of Corpus diff Widget.

\subsubsection{Lexicon Module}

The lexicon module show in Table~\ref{table-lexicon} is used for search. It is loosely modeled after a mental lexicon, in a network of morphemes, allomorphs, orthographie(s), glosses and translations.  It is not a dictionary but rather a connected graph similar to theoretical models of mental lexicons (for a dictionary see the Dictionary Module in \S~\ref{module-dictionary}). As a connected graph it is the most useful structure to index datum and search for datum real time while data entry is happening. 
%One requested use-case was to have the search open for a particular morpheme/category and have datum which are entered show up in the search results. 

We estimate the total cost of the lexicon module to be around \$7,300 before taxes. The implementation of the lexicon module was begun on April 20th 2012. We will know its final costs on August 3rd 2012.

\subsection{``Dream'' Modules}

The "dream" modules allow for more features that will save researchers time in their data entry and data analysis, but which are not necessary for simply entering and transcribing data. These modules are on hold until budget becomes available.


\subsubsection{Language Learning Module}
The language learning module shown in Table ~\ref{tab:langlearn} enables researchers and language teachers to create language learning aids from the data in existing corpora and from the data newly collected for the purpose of language learning. The learning aids aim to help language learners improve their listening and speaking skills. The orthographic lines (i.e. utterance and morpheme lines) and the attached audio or video recordings of a datum are taken as materials to create a lesson. 


The prototype of the language learning module was begun on September 13th 2012.

\subsubsection{Phonological Search Module}
The phonological search module shown in Table~\ref{tab:phono} is used to search for phonological features in context. It consists of a phonology ontology (a general purpose feature geometry/articulatory feature ontology, or a customized ontology created by the users for their language of interest) which lets the user search for potential minimal pairs or phonological features in context to verify with consultants or to prepare psycholinguistic experiments. The phonological search module is used by the {\it  phonetic aligner} module to generate a ``dictionary.txt'' file containing orthography and phones which is used by the phonetic aligner module.

We estimate the cost of the phonological search module to be roughly \$2,200 before taxes. The Phonological search, or the phonetic aligner module is currently schedule to begin in September 2012, we haven't yet decided which is a priority.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Phonetic Aligner Module}
The phonetic aligner module show in Table~\ref{tab:aligner} makes it possible to use attached audio recordings and the orthographic/utterance lines of datum to create a dictionary unique to the corpus' language, and to run the ProsodyLab Aligner, a machine learning algorithm which uses Hidden Markov Models to predict boundaries between phones and creates a Praat TextGrid with estimated phone boundaries, saving hours of boundary tagging. We also have factored in a bit of sound editing to facilitate the process of creating audio files which correspond closely to the utterance line in the datum's fields. 


We estimate the cost of the phonetic aligner module to be roughly \$9,800 before taxes. The phonetic aligner or the phonological search module is currently scheduled to begin in September 2012, we haven't yet decided which is a priority.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Dictionary Module}

The dictionary module shown in Table~\ref{tab:dictionary}is used to crawl the corpus to gather citations and examples to build a Wiktionary dictionary for the corpus' language, as required by some grants which focus on endangered/minority languages. The dictionary module is quite complex and the central component of many online fieldlinguistics databases.   

We estimate the dictionary module to cost roughly \$ 18,800 before taxes. The dictionary module is not currently scheduled until we have more users who require its functionality.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Glosser Module}
The glosser module show in Table~\ref{tab:glosser} is designed to make the app ``smarter'' and to reduce the amount of time spent entering predictable information such as glosses. The glosser can use any existing morphological analysis tool to break down the utterance/orthography line  into a probable morphological segmentation using known morphemes in the lexicon, and enters a probable gloss for the morphemes in the glossing line. The glosser module is designed to reduce redundant data entry, not to provide accurate glosses. It is of course crucial that predicted morpheme segmentation and glosses be corrected by users, particularly in languages where morphemes are ambiguous, or where morphemes are short and hence there are more ambiguous morpheme segmentations for words. 


We estimate the glosser module to cost roughly \$17,800. The glosser module is not currently scheduled until we have more users who require its functionality.

\subsubsection{Web Spider Module}

The Web Spider module shown in Table~\ref{table-spider} is a non-crucial module which allows researchers with limited access to consultants to gather data using blogs or forums. The web spider also provides an additional source of context to assist consultants in providing grammaticality judgements, as well as additional contexts where morphemes appear. For example, ``ke'' is largely considered a postposition by Urdu-consultants with explicit knowledge, however it is often produced as other functional morphemes in everyday spoken contexts. Blog/forum data can be used to discover these additional contexts.


The Web Spider module is currently not a scheduled module.  It will not become a priority until we have more users who require its functionality.

\subsubsection{User Support \& Maintenance}

The user support  \& maintenance module shown in Table~\ref{tab:support} includes general support, new features, upgrades, and maintenance. User support includes answering user's emails, helping system administrators install the app and its various server apps on their department server, creating video tutorials, screen casts and sample data to help users figure out the application and begin using it immediately, as well as discover some of its advanced/unexpected features. 

We estimate the user support \& maintenance module to cost roughly \$30,200 if we include unlimited support, or \$13,000 if we do not include email and tech support but only new features, maintenance, video tutorials and user guides.
