\section {Project Abstract}

The FieldLinguists' App is an OpenSource database that allows language researchers to securely enter, store, organize, annotate, and share linguistic data. The application is accessible everywhere; it runs on three different systems (Mac, Linux, and Windows)  and is suitable for both online and offline use.  Furthermore, the application will be created with collaborative goals in mind;  data will be syncable and sharable with other researchers.  Researchers can form teams that contributes to a single corpus, where team members can modify and discuss the data from within the application. The system will also have a simple and friendly user interface, allowing participants to drag and drop files (audio, video, text), or record it directly into the database when using the Android app. In addition, the application will have import and export capabilities for multiple file types.  Most importantly, the application is designed intuitively and theory free, so it is not necessary to be a field linguist or programmer to figure out how it works.

\section {Statement of Need}

The statement of need should describe the problem that the project will attempt to address. Also, 
describe the population that will be served.  

\section {App Description}

Describe the project or program and provide information on how it will be implemented. Include 
information on what will be accomplished and the desired outcome. 

\section {Goals \& Objectives}

Describe the project objectives in measurable terms that address the academic and technological needs of language teachers, linguists, etc. (it's for linguists but other people can benefit from it as well i.e. help create dictionaries for endangered languages, which will benefit the communities of these languages; L2 acq. teachers).  

\section {Staff \& Organizational Information}

 iLanguage Lab is a Montreal based company that develops tools in the form of experimentation and data collection apps for Android and Chrome in collaboration with researchers at UdeM, UQAM, McGill and Concordia. Previous research applications includes the Bilingual Aphasia Test, AuBlog, OPrime and SpyOrNot.  Furthermore, iLanguage Lab has a background in assisting researchers obtain results and publications.  The AuBlog application was employed to investigate evolving information structure and audienceless vs. audience oriented prosodies and culminated in a poster presented at Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Prosody Conference. The Bilingual Aphasia Test led to a presentation at the  Academy of Aphasia 49th Annual Meeting on  Aphasia Assessment on Android: recording voice, eye-gaze and touch for the BAT and a publication in the Academy of Aphasia. 

\subsection{Gina Cook M.A.}

Gina Cook received her Masters in Field Linguistics \& DESS in Computer Science and has worked as a computational linguist for companies such as Nuance and Idelia.  She founded iLanguage Lab with a vision to develop computational tools to help researchers as opposed to consumers.  She is an active contributor to OpenSource projects on GitHub focusing on integrating existing OpenSource libraries for Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Eye Gaze analysis and Acoustic analysis into Android tablet applications.

\section {Budget}

The Field Linguists' Database is composed eight modules and thus the cost is divided into eight major components.  In addition,  a separate price is given for software architecture and for 1 year of user support, and project growth; needed to make a longterm viable and useful tool that fieldlinguists can adopt for their labs or for their field methods courses. The collaboration module is used to permit collaboration with teams and users.  The Corpus Module is used to sync, share, edit, tag, categorize and open data. The Lexicon Module is used to house, and read lexicon entries to be used for the glosser.   The Dictionary Module is used to share the lexicon in the form of a WordNet/Wiktionary dictionary with the language community as required by some grants.  The Glosser Module is used to automatically gloss datum, smarter than the standard lexicon. Finally,  the Aligner Module is used to create TextGrids from the orthography and the audio files, used for prosody and phonetic analysis. 


The prices given include a 40\% Researcher discount and a 10\% Open Source discount.  An additional 40\% discount is given for certain components that can be made with the help of students from Concordia University, Hisako Noguchi and Yulia Manyakina.  The cost is calculated by determining the time in hours and multiplying by \$48, the average rate of a software developer in Montr\'eal.
